	abstract = {Background: Detecting similar ligand-binding sites in globally unrelated proteins has a wide range of applications in modern drug discovery, including drug repurposing, the prediction of side effects, and drug-target interactions. Although a number of techniques to compare binding pockets have been developed, this problem still poses significant challenges.
Results: We evaluate the performance of three algorithms to calculate similarities between ligand-binding sites, APoc, SiteEngine, and G-LoSA. Our assessment considers not only the capabilities to identify similar pockets and to construct accurate local alignments, but also the dependence of these alignments on the sequence order. We point out certain drawbacks of previously compiled datasets, such as the inclusion of structurally similar proteins, leading to an overestimated performance. To address these issues, a rigorous procedure to prepare unbiased, high-quality benchmarking sets is proposed. Further, we conduct a comparative assessment of techniques directly aligning binding pockets to indirect strategies employing structure-based virtual screening with AutoDock Vina and rDock.
Conclusions: Thorough benchmarks reveal that G-LoSA offers a fairly robust overall performance, whereas the accuracy of APoc and SiteEngine is satisfactory only against easy datasets. Moreover, combining various algorithms into a meta-predictor improves the performance of existing methods to detect similar binding sites in unrelated proteins by 5–10\%.

	abstract = {The binding of drugs and reagents to oﬀ-targets is well-known. Whereas many oﬀ-targets are related to the primary target by sequence and fold, many ligands bind to unrelated pairs of proteins, and these are harder to anticipate. If the binding site in the oﬀ-target can be related to that of the primary target, this challenge resolves into aligning the two pockets. However, other cases are possible: the ligand might interact with entirely diﬀerent residues and environments in the oﬀ-target, or wholly diﬀerent ligand atoms may be implicated in the two complexes. To investigate these scenarios at atomic resolution, the structures of 59 ligands in 116 complexes (62 pairs in total), where the protein pairs were unrelated by fold but bound an identical ligand, were examined. In almost half of the pairs, the ligand interacted with unrelated residues in the two proteins (29 pairs), and in 14 of the pairs wholly diﬀerent ligand moieties were implicated in each complex. Even in those 19 pairs of complexes that presented similar environments to the ligand, ligand superposition rarely resulted in the overlap of related residues. There appears to be no single pattern-matching “code” for identifying binding sites in unrelated proteins that bind identical ligands, though modeling suggests that there might be a limited number of diﬀerent patterns that suﬃce to recognize diﬀerent ligand functional groups.},

              Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort
              1–4
              , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined
              5
              , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences
              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’
              8
              —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years
              9
              . Despite recent progress
              10–14
              , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)
              15
              , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

              Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure

              , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

Various stages of computational and chemical biology research can benefit from this knowledge. The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios. Specific evaluation data sets were developed to shed light on multiple aspects of binding site comparison. An assembly of all applied benchmark sets (ProSPECCTs–Protein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) is made available for the evaluation and optimization of further and still emerging methods.},

	abstract = {Detection of remote binding site similarity in proteins plays an important role for drug repositioning and off-target effect prediction. Various non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and van-derWaals forces drive ligands' molecular recognition by binding sites in proteins. The increasing amount of available structures of protein-small molecule complexes enabled the development of comparative approaches. Several methods have been developed to characterize and compare proteineligand interaction patterns. Usually implemented as ﬁngerprints, these are mainly used for post processing docking scores and (off-)target prediction. In the latter application, interaction proﬁles detect similarities in the bound interactions of different ligands and thus identify essential interactions between a protein and its small molecule ligands. Interaction pattern similarity correlates with binding site similarity and is thus contributing to a higher precision in binding site similarity assessment of proteins with distinct global structure. This renders it valuable for existing drug repositioning approaches in structural bioinformatics. Current methods to characterize and compare structure-based interaction patterns e both for proteinsmall-molecule and proteineprotein interactions e as well as their potential in target prediction will be reviewed in this article. The question of how the set of interaction types, ﬂexibility or water-mediated interactions, inﬂuence the comparison of interaction patterns will be discussed. Due to the wealth of proteineligand structures available today, predicted targets can be ranked by comparing their ligand interaction pattern to patterns of the known target. Such knowledge-based methods offer high precision in comparison to methods comparing whole binding sites based on shape and amino acid physicochemical similarity.},

A novel approach for identification of off-targets by direct superposition of protein binding pocket surfaces is presented and applied to a set of well-studied and highly relevant drug targets, including representative kinases and nuclear hormone receptors. The entire Protein Data Bank is searched for similar binding pockets and convincing distant off-target candidates were identified that share no significant sequence or fold similarity with the respective target structure. These putative target off-target pairs are further supported by the existence of compounds that bind strongly to both with high topological similarity, and in some cases, literature examples of individual compounds that bind to both. Also, our results clearly show that it is possible for binding pockets to exhibit a striking surface similarity, while the respective off-target shares neither significant sequence nor significant fold similarity with the respective molecular target (‘‘distant off-target’’).},

	abstract = {Drug repositioning applies established drugs to new disease indications with increasing success. A pre-requisite for drug repurposing is drug promiscuity (polypharmacology) – a drug’s ability to bind to several targets. There is a long standing debate on the reasons for drug promiscuity. Based on large compound screens, hydrophobicity and molecular weight have been suggested as key reasons. However, the results are sometimes contradictory and leave space for further analysis. Protein structures offer a structural dimension to explain promiscuity: Can a drug bind multiple targets because the drug is flexible or because the targets are structurally similar or even share similar binding sites? We present a systematic study of drug promiscuity based on structural data of PDB target proteins with a set of 164 promiscuous drugs. We show that there is no correlation between the degree of promiscuity and ligand properties such as hydrophobicity or molecular weight but a weak correlation to conformational flexibility. However, we do find a correlation between promiscuity and structural similarity as well as binding site similarity of protein targets. In particular, 71\% of the drugs have at least two targets with similar binding sites. In order to overcome issues in detection of remotely similar binding sites, we employed a score for binding site similarity: LigandRMSD measures the similarity of the aligned ligands and uncovers remote local similarities in proteins. It can be applied to arbitrary structural binding site alignments. Three representative examples, namely the anticancer drug methotrexate, the natural product quercetin and the anti-diabetic drug acarbose are discussed in detail. Our findings suggest that global structural and binding site similarity play a more important role to explain the observed drug promiscuity in the PDB than physicochemical drug properties like hydrophobicity or molecular weight. Additionally, we find ligand flexibility to have a minor influence.},

These interactions often occur in small cavities within protein structures, known as ligand-binding pockets. Understanding the physicochemical qualities of binding pockets is essential to improve not only our basic knowledge of biological systems, but also drug development procedures. In order to quantify similarities among pockets in terms of their geometries and chemical properties, either bound ligands can be compared to one another or binding sites can be matched directly. Both perspectives routinely take advantage of computational methods including various techniques to represent and compare small molecules as well as local protein structures. In this review, we survey 12 tools widely used to match pockets. These methods are divided into five categories based on the algorithm implemented to construct binding-site alignments. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of their algorithms, test sets and the performance of each method are described. We also discuss general pharmacological applications of computational pocket matching in drug repurposing, polypharmacology and side effects. Reflecting on the importance of these techniques in drug discovery, in the end, we elaborate on the development of more accurate meta-predictors, the incorporation of protein flexibility and the integration of powerful artificial intelligence technologies such as deep learning.},

Each interaction (hydrophobic, aromatic, hydrogen bond, ionic bond, metal complexation) is detected on the ﬂy and physically described by a pseudoatom centered either on the interacting ligand atom, the interacting protein atom, or the geometric center of both interacting atoms. Counting all possible triplets of interaction pseudoatoms within six distance ranges, and pruning the full integer vector to keep the most frequent triplets enables the deﬁnition of a simple (210 integers) and coordinate frame-invariant interaction pattern descriptor (TIFP) that can be applied to compare any pair of protein−ligand complexes. TIFP ﬁngerprints have been calculated for ca. 10 000 druggable protein−ligand complexes therefore enabling a wide comparison of relationships between interaction pattern similarity and ligand or binding site pairwise similarity. We notably show that interaction pattern similarity strongly depends on binding site similarity. In addition to the TIFP ﬁngerprint which registers intermolecular interactions between a ligand and its target protein, we developed two tools (Ishape, Grim) to align protein−ligand complexes from their interaction patterns. Ishape is based on the overlap of interaction pseudoatoms using a smooth Gaussian function, whereas Grim utilizes a standard clique detection algorithm to match interaction pattern graphs. Both tools are complementary and enable protein−ligand complex alignments capitalizing on both global and local pattern similarities. The new ﬁngerprint and companion alignment tools have been successfully used in three scenarios: (i) interaction-biased alignment of protein−ligand complexes, (ii) postprocessing docking poses according to known interaction patterns for a particular target, and (iii) virtual screening for bioisosteric scaﬀolds sharing similar interaction patterns.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-ofthe-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. This is the ﬁrst large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high conﬁdence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.},

	abstract = {The structural comparison of protein binding sites is increasingly important in drug design; identifying structurally similar sites can be useful for techniques such as drug repurposing, and also in a polypharmacological approach to deliberately affect multiple targets in a disease pathway, or to explain unwanted off-target effects. Once similar sites are identified, identifying local differences can aid in the design of selectivity. Such an approach moves away from the classical “one target one drug” approach and toward a wider systems biology paradigm. Here, we report a semiautomated approach, called BioGPS, that is based on the software FLAP which combines GRID Molecular Interactions Fields (MIFs) and pharmacophoric fingerprints. BioGPS comprises the automatic preparation of protein structure data, identification of binding sites, and subsequent comparison by aligning the sites and directly comparing the MIFs. Chemometric approaches are included to reduce the complexity of the resulting data on large datasets, enabling focus on the most relevant information. Individual site similarities can be analyzed in terms of their Pharmacophoric Interaction Field (PIF) similarity, and importantly the differences in their PIFs can be extracted. Here we describe the BioGPS approach, and demonstrate its applicability to rationalize offtarget effects (ERa and SERCA), to classify protein families and explain polypharmacology (ABL1 kinase and NQO2), and to rationalize selectivity between subfamilies (MAP kinases p38a/ERK2 and PPARd/PPARc). The examples shown demonstrate a significant validation of the method and illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {Bioisosteres have been deﬁned as structurally diﬀerent molecules or substructures that can form comparable intermolecular interactions, and therefore, fragments that bind to similar protein structures exhibit a degree of bioisosterism. We present KRIPO (Key Representation of Interaction in POckets): a new method for quantifying the similarities of binding site subpockets based on pharmacophore ﬁngerprints. The binding site ﬁngerprints have been optimized to improve their performance for both intra- and interprotein family comparisons. A range of attributes of the ﬁngerprints was considered in the optimization, including the placement of pharmacophore features, whether or not the ﬁngerprints are fuzziﬁed, and the resolution and complexity of the pharmacophore ﬁngerprints (2-, 3-, and 4-point ﬁngerprints). Fuzzy 3-point pharmacophore ﬁngerprints were found to represent the optimal balance between computational resource requirements and the identiﬁcation of potential replacements. The complete PDB was converted into a database comprising almost 300 000 optimized ﬁngerprints of local binding sites together with their associated ligand fragments. The value of the approach is demonstrated by application to two crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank: (1) a MAP kinase P38 structure in complex with a pyridinylimidazole inhibitor (1A9U) and (2) a complex of thrombin with melagatran (1K22). Potentially valuable bioisosteric replacements for all subpockets of the two studied protein are identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {A novel method to measure distances between druggable protein cavities is presented. Starting from user-defined ligand binding sites, eight topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages: (i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins is simply done by systematically rotating/ translating one mobile sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties (e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign) and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands with various promiscuity levels. The proposed method is robust enough to detect local similarity among active sites of different sizes, to discriminate between protein subfamilies and to recover the known targets of promiscuous ligands by virtual screening.},

The scoring function can be used to determine the binding mode and site of a ligand, predict binding affinity and identify the potential drug leads for a given protein target. Despite intensive research over the years, accurate and rapid prediction of protein–ligand interactions is still a challenge in molecular docking. For this reason, this study reviews four basic types of scoring functions, physics-based, empirical, knowledgebased, and machine learning-based scoring functions, based on an up-to-date classification scheme. We not only discuss the foundations of the four types scoring functions, suitable application areas and shortcomings, but also discuss challenges and potential future study directions.},

	abstract = {Protein pocket matching, or binding site comparison, is of importance in drug discovery. Identiﬁcation of similar binding pockets can help guide eﬀorts for hit-ﬁnding, understanding polypharmacology, and characterization of protein function. The design of pocket matching methods has traditionally involved much intuition and has employed a broad variety of algorithms and representations of the input protein structures. We regard the high heterogeneity of past work and the recent availability of large-scale benchmarks as an indicator that a datadriven approach may provide a new perspective. We propose DeeplyTough, a convolutional neural network that encodes a three-dimensional representation of protein pockets into descriptor vectors that may be compared eﬃciently in an alignment-free manner by computing pairwise Euclidean distances. The network is trained with supervision (i) to provide similar pockets with similar descriptors, (ii) to separate the descriptors of dissimilar pockets by a minimum margin, and (iii) to achieve robustness to nuisance variations. We evaluate our method using three large-scale benchmark datasets, on which it demonstrates excellent performance for held-out data coming from the training distribution and competitive performance when the trained network is required to generalize to datasets constructed independently. DeeplyTough is available at https://github.com/BenevolentAI/DeeplyTough.},

Classification of binding sites has been a hot topic for the past 30 years, and many different methods have been published. The rapid development of machine learning computational algorithms, coupled with the large volume of publicly available protein−ligand 3D structures, makes it possible to apply deep learning techniques in binding site comparison. Our method uses a cutting-edge spherical convolutional neural network based on the DeepSphere architecture to learn global representations of protein-binding sites. The model was trained on TOUGH-C1 and TOUGH-M1 data and validated with the ProSPECCTs datasets. Our results show that our model can (1) perform well in protein-binding site similarity and classification tasks and (2) learn and separate the physicochemical properties of binding sites. Lastly, we tested the model on a set of kinases, where the results show that it is able to cluster the different kinase subfamilies effectively. This example demonstrates the method’s promise for lead hopping within or outside a protein target, directly based on binding site information.},

            Biomedical data is accumulating at a fast pace and integrating it into a unified framework is a major challenge, so that multiple views of a given biological event can be considered simultaneously. Here we present the Bioteque, a resource of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., ‘drug treats disease’, ‘gene interacts with gene’). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.},

A detailed structural and physico-chemical characterization of these interactions could significantly deepen our understanding of protein function and facilitate drug design. Here, we present a large-scale study on a non-redundant set of about 20,000 known ligand-binding sites, or pockets, of proteins. We find that the structural space of protein pockets is crowded, likely complete, and may be represented by about 1,000 pocket shapes. Correspondingly, the growth rate of novel pockets deposited in the Protein Data Bank has been decreasing steadily over the recent years. Moreover, many protein pockets are promiscuous and interact with ligands of diverse scaffolds. Conversely, many ligands are promiscuous and interact with structurally different pockets. Through a physico-chemical and structural analysis, we provide insights into understanding both pocket promiscuity and ligand promiscuity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study for the prediction of protein-ligand interactions based on pocket comparison.},

            In the recent years, the improvement of software and hardware performance has made biomolecular simulations a mature tool for the study of biological processes. Simulation length and the size and complexity of the analyzed systems make simulations both complementary and compatible with other bioinformatics disciplines. However, the characteristics of the software packages used for simulation have prevented the adoption of the technologies accepted in other bioinformatics fields like automated deployment systems, workflow orchestration, or the use of software containers. We present here a comprehensive exercise to bring biomolecular simulations to the “bioinformatics way of working”. The exercise has led to the development of the BioExcel Building Blocks (BioBB) library. BioBB’s are built as Python wrappers to provide an interoperable architecture. BioBB’s have been integrated in a chain of usual software management tools to generate data ontologies, documentation, installation packages, software containers and ways of integration with workflow managers, that make them usable in most computational environments.},

Results: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.
Conclusions: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry. It is freely available under an open-source license from http://openbabel.org.},

Under this scenario, there is an urgent need for new approaches to chemically address these yet untargeted proteins. It is widely recognized that the best starting point for generating novel small molecules for proteins is to exploit the expected polypharmacology of known active ligands across phylogenetically related proteins following the paradigm that similar proteins are likely to interact with similar ligands. Here, we introduce a computational strategy to identify privileged structures that, when chemically expanded, are highly probable to contain active small molecules for untargeted proteins. The protocol was first tested on a set of 576 currently targeted proteins having at least one protein family sibling the year before their first active ligand was reported. A privileged structure contained in active ligands that were identified in the following years was correctly anticipated for 214 (37\%) of those targeted proteins, a lower-bound recall estimate when considering data completeness issues. When applied to a set of 1184 untargeted potential druggable genes in cancer, the identification of privileged structures from known bioactive ligands of protein family siblings allowed for extracting a priority list of diverse commercially available small molecules for 960 of them. Assuming a minimum success rate of 37\%, the chemical library selections should be able to deliver active ligands for at least 355 currently untargeted proteins associated with cancer.},

            Medicinal chemistry has discovered thousands of potent protein and lipid kinase inhibitors. These may be developed into therapeutic drugs or chemical probes to study kinase biology. Because of polypharmacology, a large part of the human kinome currently lacks selective chemical probes. To discover such probes, we profiled 1,183 compounds from drug discovery projects in lysates of cancer cell lines using Kinobeads. The resulting 500,000 compound–target interactions are available in ProteomicsDB and we exemplify how this molecular resource may be used. For instance, the data revealed several hundred reasonably selective compounds for 72 kinases. Cellular assays validated GSK986310C as a candidate SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) probe and X-ray crystallography uncovered the structural basis for the observed selectivity of the CK2 inhibitor GW869516X. Compounds targeting PKN3 were discovered and phosphoproteomics identified substrates that indicate target engagement in cells. We anticipate that this molecular resource will aid research in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

            Chemical descriptors encode the physicochemical and structural properties of small molecules, and they are at the core of chemoinformatics. The broad release of bioactivity data has prompted enriched representations of compounds, reaching beyond chemical structures and capturing their known biological properties. Unfortunately, bioactivity descriptors are not available for most small molecules, which limits their applicability to a few thousand well characterized compounds. Here we present a collection of deep neural networks able to infer bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest, even when little or no experimental information is available for them. Our signaturizers relate to bioactivities of 25 different types (including target profiles, cellular response and clinical outcomes) and can be used as drop-in replacements for chemical descriptors in day-to-day chemoinformatics tasks. Indeed, we illustrate how inferred bioactivity signatures are useful to navigate the chemical space in a biologically relevant manner, unveiling higher-order organization in natural product collections, and to enrich mostly uncharacterized chemical libraries for activity against the drug-orphan target Snail1. Moreover, we implement a battery of signature-activity relationship (SigAR) models and show a substantial improvement in performance, with respect to chemistry-based classifiers, across a series of biophysics and physiology activity prediction benchmarks.},

This outstanding success prompted us to evaluate how accurate AF models are from the perspective of docking-based drug discovery. We compared the high-throughput docking (HTD) performance of AF models with their corresponding experimental PDB structures using a benchmark set of 22 targets. The AF models showed consistently worse performance using four docking programs and two consensus techniques. Although AlphaFold shows a remarkable ability to predict protein architecture, this might not be enough to guarantee that AF models can be reliably used for HTD, and post-modeling reﬁnement strategies might be key to increase the chances of success.},

In a subset of 27 targets where the AF2 structures are suitable for refinement, the AF2 structures show comparable early enrichment of known active compounds (avg.

With an induced-fit protocol (IFD-MD), we can refine the AF2 structures using an aligned known binding ligand as the template to improve the performance in structure-based virtual screening (avg. EF 1\%: 18.9). Glide-generated docking poses of known binding ligands can also be used as templates for IFD-MD, achieving similar improvements (avg. EF 1\% 18.0).

To address this question, we redocked ligands in the PDBbind datasets against the experimental co-crystallized receptor structures and against the AlphaFold2 structures using AutoDock-GPU.

Removing low-confidence regions of the predicted structure and making side chains flexible improves the docking outcomes. Overall, despite high-quality prediction of backbone conformation, fine structural details limit the naive application of AlphaFold2 models as docking targets.},

	abstract = {ProBiS (Protein Binding Sites), a local structure-based comparison algorithm, is used in the new ProBiS-Fold web server to annotate human structures from the AlphaFold database without a corresponding structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to discover new druggable binding sites. The ProBiS algorithm is used to compare each query protein structure predicted by the AlphaFold approach with the protein structures from the PDB to identify similarities between known binding sites found in the PDB and yet unknown binding sites in the AlphaFold database. Ligands bound in these identified similar PDB sites are then transferred to each query protein from the AlphaFold database, and binding sites are identified as ligand clusters on an AlphaFold protein. Small molecule binding sites are assigned druggability scores based on the similarity of their ligands to known drugs, allowing them to be ranked according to their perceived and actual potential for drug development. ProBiS-Fold provides interactive and downloadable binding sites for the entire human structural proteome, including more than 3000 new druggable binding sites that have no corresponding structure in the PDB, taking into account AlphaFold’s model quality, to enable protein structure−function relationship studies and pharmaceutical drug discovery research.

Recent developments in protein structure prediction and the 3D structures built by AlphaFold provide an unprecedented opportunity for analyzing ligand binding sites in human proteins. Here, we constructed the CavitySpace database, the ﬁrst pocket library for all the proteins in the human proteome, using a widely-applied ligand binding site detection program CAVITY.

We grouped the predicted binding sites according to their similarity which can be used in protein function prediction and drug repurposing studies. Novel binding sites in highly reliable predicted structure regions provide new opportunities for drug discovery.

              Despite major advances in protein structure determination and prediction, it remains challenging to identify small-molecule ligands for most proteins. Offensperger
              et al
              . used a chemical proteomics approach to map protein-ligand interactions across the human proteome. With a library of around 400 ligand fragments attached to a photoactivatable cross-linker, the authors identified about 50,000 statistically significant interactions over about 2500 proteins, including a large fraction of targets for which there are no prior known ligands. They validated these results with biochemical experiments, identifying from their screen an E3 ligase binder and an inhibitor of a transmembrane transporter. This rich interaction dataset also provided the basis for developing a machine learning model to predict fragment properties and interaction profiles. The authors have made their work available as an online community resource. —Michael A. Funk

              INTRODUCTION
              Chemical modulation of protein function is an important experimental approach to illuminate biological mechanisms and represents the most frequently used strategy to treat human disease. Nevertheless, around 80\% of the human proteome lacks annotated small-molecule ligands, thus leaving many proteins, including validated disease targets, outside the reach of mechanistic elucidation and therapeutic innovation.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              To close this gap, unbiased approaches to advance ligand discovery are urgently needed. We set out to determine the proteome-wide binding preferences of more than 400 small-molecule fragments through a chemoproteomics strategy that is based on treatment of intact cells. With these data at hand, we aimed to (i) identify hundreds of fragment-protein interactions and advance selected fragments toward cell-active ligands, (ii) leverage machine learning (ML) binary classifiers to develop models to predict small-molecule behavior in native biological systems, and (iii) build an interactive open-source interface to empower the broad exploration of the data and of all predictive models.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Through this quantitative chemoproteomics strategy, we experimentally determined the interactome of 407 small-molecule fragments. This led to the identification of 47,658 discrete fragment-protein interactions involving more than 2600 proteins, of which 86\% previously lacked any annotated ligand. To provide evidence for the translational potential of these starting points, we advanced various hits toward elaborated fragments. With focused synthetic efforts, we developed ligands that (i) engage the E3 ligase adaptor protein DDB1, (ii) functionally block the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter SLC29A1 (hENT1), or (iii) selectively inhibit a subset of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), including the orphan CDK16. In addition to advancing individual fragment-protein hits, we leveraged the depth of the global dataset to develop an ML framework to build models that can predict how fragments interact with native proteins on a proteome-wide scale. This framework included inference of quantitative fragment interactomes, which enabled us to predict to how many proteins a given fragment will bind and whether the bound proteins themselves are chemically broadly accessible or otherwise typically refractory to small-molecule ligands. Moreover, ML models allowed us to capture and predict qualitative interactome signatures. This made it possible for us to investigate and predict whether fragments tend to interact with subsets of proteins of coherent function, such as transporters or RNA-binding proteins. Likewise, ML models allowed us to analyze and predict whether fragments tend to interact with groups of proteins that reside in defined subcellular localizations or compartments, such as lysosomes or mitochondria, which can be indicative of intracellular fragment partitioning and accumulation. Last, we have also provided a platform to develop bespoke ML models that are based on a user-defined input of target proteins, and hence enable the prediction of fragment binding to a custom set of proteins.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                Our large-scale chemical proteomics survey led to the identification of hundreds of fragment-protein interactions that are poised for future exploration and chemical optimization. Moreover, we found that the generated data is amenable to ML-based models that enable us to predict how chemical matter interacts with native proteomes in intact cells by using their chemical structure as input. To maximize the practical use for the scientific community, all interactomes, enrichment tools, and ML models have been made publicly available for exploration through a web-based application (
                https://ligand-discovery.ai
                ). Collectively, these data and tools should form a resource to interpret fragment-binding data and expedite ligand discovery efforts.
              
              
                
                  Schematic representation of the ligand discovery approach.
                  Chemoproteomics was used to assess 407 small-molecule fragments. Hundreds of fragment-protein interactions were identified as starting points for probe development. System-level analyses coupled to machine learning enabled prediction of fragment binding and behavior in living cells. An interactive web resource has been provided for data exploration, which also allows the generation and application of bespoke predictive models.},

	abstract = {Molecular representation learning (MRL) has gained tremendous attention due to its critical role in learning from limited supervised data for applications like drug design. In most MRL methods, molecules are treated as 1D sequential tokens or 2D topology graphs, limiting their ability to incorporate 3D information for downstream tasks and, in particular, making it almost impossible for 3D geometry prediction/generation. In this paper, we propose a universal 3D MRL framework, called Uni-Mol, that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope of MRL schemes. Uni-Mol contains two pretrained models with the same SE(3) Transformer architecture: a molecular model pretrained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket model pretrained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. Besides, Uni-Mol contains several finetuning strategies to apply the pretrained models to various downstream tasks. By properly incorporating 3D information, Uni-Mol outperforms SOTA in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction, molecular conformation generation, etc. The code, model, and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol.},

	abstract = {An item is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Most biological molecules are chiral. The homochirality of amino acids ensures that proteins are chiral, which is essential for their functions. Chirality also occurs at the whole-cell level, which was first studied mostly in ciliates, single-celled protozoans. Ciliates show chirality in their cortical structures, which is not determined by genetics, but by ‘cortical inheritance’. These studies suggested that molecular chirality directs whole-cell chirality. Intriguingly, chirality in cellular structures and functions is also found in metazoans. In
              Drosophila
              , intrinsic cell chirality is observed in various left–right (LR) asymmetric tissues, and appears to be responsible for their LR asymmetric morphogenesis. In other invertebrates, such as snails and
              Caenorhabditis elegans
              , blastomere chirality is responsible for subsequent LR asymmetric development. Various cultured cells of vertebrates also show intrinsic chirality in their cellular behaviours and intracellular structural dynamics. Thus, cell chirality may be a general property of eukaryotic cells. In
              Drosophila
              , cell chirality drives the LR asymmetric development of individual organs, without establishing the LR axis of the whole embryo. Considering that organ-intrinsic LR asymmetry is also reported in vertebrates, this mechanism may contribute to LR asymmetric development across phyla.

	abstract = {Small organic molecules are often ﬂexible, i.e., they can adopt a variety of low-energy conformations in solution that exist in equilibrium with each other. Two main search strategies are used to generate representative conformational ensembles for molecules: systematic and stochastic. In the ﬁrst approach, each rotatable bond is sampled systematically in discrete intervals, limiting its use to molecules with a small number of rotatable bonds. Stochastic methods, on the other hand, sample the conformational space of a molecule randomly and can thus be applied to more ﬂexible molecules. Diﬀerent methods employ diﬀerent degrees of experimental data for conformer generation. So-called knowledge-based methods use predeﬁned libraries of torsional angles and ring conformations. In the distance geometry approach, on the other hand, a smaller amount of empirical information is used, i.e., ideal bond lengths, ideal bond angles, and a few ideal torsional angles. Distance geometry is a computationally fast method to generate conformers, but it has the downside that purely distance-based constraints tend to lead to distorted aromatic rings and sp2 centers. To correct this, the resulting conformations are often minimized with a force ﬁeld, adding computational complexity and run time. Here we present an alternative strategy that combines the distance geometry approach with experimental torsionangle preferences obtained from small-molecule crystallographic data. The torsional angles are described by a previously developed set of hierarchically structured SMARTS patterns. The new approach is implemented in the open-source cheminformatics library RDKit, and its performance is assessed by comparing the diversity of the generated ensemble and the ability to reproduce crystal conformations taken from the crystal structures of small molecules and protein−ligand complexes.},

Escitalopram can be considered as an allosteric serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This serotonin dual action in binding to two sites on the serotonin transporter (both the primary site and the allosteric site) is hypothesised to be responsible for a longer binding to, and therefore greater inhibition of the serotonin transporter by escitalopram.},

	abstract = {Proteins are often enantioselective towards their binding partners. When designing small molecules to interact with these targets, one should consider stereoselectivity. As considerations for exploring structure space evolve, chirality is increasingly important. Binding affinity for a chiral drug can differ for diastereomers and between enantiomers. For the virtual screening and computational design stage of drug development, this problem can be compounded by incomplete stereochemical information in structure libraries leading to a “coin toss” as to whether or not the “ideal” chiral structure is present. Creating every stereoisomer for each chiral compound in a structure library leads to an exponential increase in the number of structures resulting in potentially unmanageable file sizes and screening times. Therefore, only key chiral structures, enantiomeric pairs based on relative stereochemistry need be included, and lead to a compromise between exploration of chemical space and maintaining manageable libraries. In clinical environments, enantiomers of chiral drugs can have reduced, no, or even deleterious effects. This underscores the need to avoid mixtures of compounds and focus on chiral synthesis. Governmental regulations emphasizing the need to monitor chirality in drug development have increased. The United States Food and Drug Administration issued guidelines and policies in 1992 concerning the development of chiral compounds. These guidelines require that absolute stereochemistry be known for compounds with chiral centers and that this information should be established early in drug development in order that the analysis can be considered valid. From exploration of structure space to governmental regulations it is clear that the question of chirality in drug design is of vital importance.},

            The increasing volume of biomedical data in chemistry and life sciences requires the development of new methods and approaches for their handling. Here, we briefly discuss some challenges and opportunities of this fast growing area of research with a focus on those to be addressed within the BIGCHEM project. The article starts with a brief description of some available resources for “Big Data” in chemistry and a discussion of the importance of data quality. We then discuss challenges with visualization of millions of compounds by combining chemical and biological data, the expectations from mining the “Big Data” using advanced machine‐learning methods, and their applications in polypharmacology prediction and target de‐convolution in phenotypic screening. We show that the efficient exploration of billions of molecules requires the development of smart strategies. We also address the issue of secure information sharing without disclosing chemical structures, which is critical to enable bi‐party or multi‐party data sharing. Data sharing is important in the context of the recent trend of “open innovation” in pharmaceutical industry, which has led to not only more information sharing among academics and pharma industries but also the so‐called “precompetitive” collaboration between pharma companies. At the end we highlight the importance of education in “Big Data” for further progress of this area.},

Some major highlights include: the integration of Google Patents data into PubChem, which greatly expanded the coverage of the PubChem Patent data collection; the creation of the Cell Line and Taxonomy data collections, which provide quick and easy access to chemical information for a given cell line and taxon, respectively; and the update of the bioassay data model. In addition, new functionalities were added to the PubChem programmatic access protocols, PUG-REST and PUG-View, including support for target-centric data download for a given protein, gene, pathway, cell line, and taxon and the addition of the ‘standardize’ option to PUG-REST, which returns the standardized form of an input chemical structure. A signiﬁcant update was also made to PubChemRDF. The present paper provides an overview of these changes.},

ATLAS offers a large-scale view and valuable insights on protein dynamics for a large and representative set of proteins, by combining data obtained through molecular dynamics simulations with information extracted from experimental structures. Users can easily analyse dynamic properties of functional protein regions, such as domain limits (hinge positions) and residues involved in interaction with other biological molecules. Additionally, the database enables exploration of proteins with uncommon dynamic properties conditioned by their environment such as chameleon subsequences and Dual Personality Fragments.

The algorithm is \$4 times faster than CE and 20 times faster than DALI and SAL. On average, the resulting structure alignments have higher accuracy and coverage than those provided by these most often-used methods. TM-align is applied to an all-against-all structure comparison of 10 515 representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence identity cutoff ,95\%: 1996 distinct folds are found when a TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used. We also use TM-align to match the models predicted by TASSER for solved non-homologous proteins in PDB. For both folded and misfolded models, TMalign can almost always find close structural analogs, with an average root mean square deviation, RMSD, of 3 A˚ and 87\% alignment coverage. Nevertheless, there exists a significant correlation between the correctness of the predicted structure and the structural similarity of the model to the other proteins in the PDB. This correlation could be used to assist in model selection in blind protein structure predictions. The TM-align program is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-align.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades signiﬁcantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs signiﬁcantly larger and more ﬂexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a ﬁne-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-ﬁne decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms previous state-ofthe-art baselines.},

              Kinase inhibitors are an important class of drugs that block certain enzymes involved in diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. There are hundreds of kinases within the human body, so knowing the kinase “target” of each drug is essential for developing successful treatment strategies. Sometimes clinical trials can fail because drugs bind more than one target. Yet sometimes off-target effects can be beneficial, and drugs can be repurposed for treatment of additional diseases. Klaeger
              et al.
              performed a comprehensive analysis of 243 kinase inhibitors that are either approved for use or in clinical trials. They provide an open-access resource of target summaries that could help researchers develop better drugs, understand how existing drugs work, and design more effective clinical trials.

            The druggable kinome is unraveled.

              INTRODUCTION
              Molecularly targeted drugs such as imatinib and crizotinib have revolutionized the treatment of certain blood and lung cancers because of their remarkable clinical success. Over the past 20 years, protein kinases have become a major class of drug targets because these signaling biomolecules are often deregulated in disease, particularly in cancer. Today, 37 small kinase inhibitors (KIs) are approved medicines worldwide and more than 250 drug candidates are undergoing clinical evaluation.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Although it is commonly accepted that most KIs target more than one protein, the extent to which this information is available to the public varies greatly between drugs. It would seem important to thoroughly characterize the target spectrum of any drug because additional off-targets may offer opportunities, not only for repurposing but also to explain undesired side effects. To this end, we used a chemical proteomic approach (kinobeads) and quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the target space of 243 clinical KIs that are approved drugs or have been tested in humans.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The number of targets for a given drug differed substantially. Whereas some compounds showed exquisite selectivity, others targeted more than 100 kinases simultaneously, making it difficult to attribute their biological effects to any particular mode of action. Also of note is that recently developed irreversible KIs can address more kinases than their intended targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Collectively, the evaluated KIs targeted 220 kinases with submicromolar affinity, offering a view of the druggable kinome and enabling the development of a universal new selectivity metric termed CATDS (concentration- and target-dependent selectivity). All drug profiles can be interactively explored in ProteomicsDB and a purpose-built shinyApp. Many uses of this unique data and analysis resource by the scientific community can be envisaged, of which we can only highlight a few. The profiles identified many new targets for established drugs, thus improving our understanding of how these drugs might exert their phenotypic effects. For example, we evaluated novel salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) inhibitors for their ability to modulate tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, which may allow repurposing these drugs for inflammatory conditions. Integrating target space information with phosphoproteomic analysis of several EGFR inhibitors enabled the identification of drug response markers inside and outside the canonical EGFR signaling pathway. Off-target identification may also inform drug discovery projects using high-value clinical molecules as lead compounds. We illustrate such a case by a novel structure-affinity relationship analysis of MELK inhibitors based on target profiles and cocrystal structures. To assess the repurposing potential of approved or clinically advanced compounds, we used cell-based assays and mouse xenografts to show that golvatinib and cabozantinib may be used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on their FLT3 inhibitory activity.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              This work provides a rich data resource describing the target landscape of 243 clinically tested KIs. It is the most comprehensive study to date and illustrates how the information may be used in basic research, drug discovery, or clinical decision-making.
              
                
                  Schematic representation of identifying the druggable kinome.
                  A chemical proteomic approach revealed quantitative interaction profiles of 243 clinically evaluated small-molecule KIs covering half of the human kinome. Results can be interactively explored in ProteomicsDB and inform basic biology, drug discovery, and clinical decision-making.

            Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established drugs, offered a perspective on the “druggable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and drug discovery research and aid clinical decision-making.},

Through clustering analysis of a large kinome proﬁling dataset, we found a cluster of eight promiscuous kinases that on average bind more than ﬁve times more kinase inhibitors than the other 398 kinases in the dataset. To understand the structural basis of promiscuous inhibitor binding, we determined the co-crystal structure of the receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 with the type I inhibitors dasatinib and VX-680. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that DDR1 binds these type I inhibitors in an inactive conformation typically reserved for type II inhibitors. Our computational and biochemical studies show that DDR1 is unusually stable in this inactive conformation, giving a mechanistic explanation for inhibitor promiscuity. This phenotypic clustering analysis provides a strategy to obtain functional insights not available by sequence comparison alone.},

	abstract = {Owing to the dysregulation of protein kinase activity in many diseases including cancer, this enzyme family has become one of the most important drug targets in the 21st century. There are 72 FDA-approved therapeutic agents that target about two dozen different protein kinases and three of these drugs were approved in 2022. Of the approved drugs, twelve target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, four are directed against dual specificity protein kinases (MEK1/2), sixteen block nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 40 target receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 62 of these drugs are prescribed for the treatment of neoplasms (57 against solid tumors including breast, lung, and colon, ten against nonsolid tumors such as leukemia, and four against both solid and nonsolid tumors: acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, imatinib, and midostaurin). Four drugs (abrocitinib, baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib) are used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis). Of the 72 approved drugs, eighteen are used in the treatment of multiple diseases. The following three drugs received FDA approval in 2022 for the treatment of these specified diseases: abrocitinib (atopic dermatitis), futibatinib (chol­ angiocarcinomas), pacritinib (myelofibrosis). All of the FDA-approved drugs are orally effective with the exception of netarsudil, temsirolimus, and trilaciclib. This review summarizes the physicochemical properties of all 72 FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors including lipophilic efficiency and ligand efficiency.},

Information on clinical trials of SMKIs reveals that approximately 110 novel kinases are currently being explored as targets, which together with the approximately 45 targets of approved kinase inhibitors represent only about 30\% of the human kinome, indicating that there are still substantial unexplored opportunities for this drug class.

	abstract = {Background:  Ligand binding site prediction from protein structure has many applications related to elucidation of protein function and structure based drug discovery. It often represents only one step of many in complex computational drug design efforts. Although many methods have been published to date, only few of them are suitable for use in automated pipelines or for processing large datasets. These use cases require stability and speed, which disqualifies many of the recently introduced tools that are either template based or available only as web servers.
Results:  We present P2Rank, a stand-alone template-free tool for prediction of ligand binding sites based on machine learning. It is based on prediction of ligandability of local chemical neighbourhoods that are centered on points placed on the solvent accessible surface of a protein. We show that P2Rank outperforms several existing tools, which include two widely used stand-alone tools (Fpocket, SiteHound), a comprehensive consensus based tool (MetaPocket 2.0), and a recent deep learning based method (DeepSite). P2Rank belongs to the fastest available tools (requires under 1 s for prediction on one protein), with additional advantage of multi-threaded implementation.
Conclusions:  P2Rank is a new open source software package for ligand binding site prediction from protein structure. It is available as a user-friendly stand-alone command line program and a Java library. P2Rank has a lightweight installation and does not depend on other bioinformatics tools or large structural or sequence databases. Thanks to its speed and ability to make fully automated predictions, it is particularly well suited for processing large datasets or as a component of scalable structural bioinformatics pipelines.},

	abstract = {Background: Virtual screening methods start to be well established as effective approaches to identify hits, candidates and leads for drug discovery research. Among those, structure based virtual screening (SBVS) approaches aim at docking collections of small compounds in the target structure to identify potent compounds. For SBVS, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces.
Results: Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94\% and 92\% of the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the field, while being faster.
Conclusion: Fpocket provides a rapid, open source and stable basis for further developments related to protein pocket detection, efficient pocket descriptor extraction, or drugablity prediction purposes. Fpocket is freely available under the GNU GPL license at http://fpocket.sourceforge.net.},

            AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RosettaFold have greatly expanded the number of structures available for structure-based ligand discovery, even though retrospective studies have cast doubt on their direct usefulness for that goal. Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models
            prospectively
            , comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In
            retrospective
            docking screens against the σ
            2
            and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors’ experimental structures, consistent with published results.
            Prospective
            large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.},

Receptors are no longer viewed as single entities but grouped into sets of related proteins or receptor families that are explored in a systematic manner. This interdisciplinary approach attempting to derive predictive links between the chemical structures of bioactive molecules and the receptors with which these molecules interact is referred to as chemogenomics. Insights from chemogenomics are used for the rational compilation of screening sets and for the rational design and synthesis of directed chemical libraries to accelerate drug discovery.

	abstract = {While selective inhibition is one of the key assets for a small molecule drug, many diseases can only be tackled by simultaneous inhibition of several proteins. An example where achieving selectivity is especially challenging are ligands targeting human kinases. This difﬁculty arises from the high structural conservation of the kinase ATP binding sites, the area targeted by most inhibitors. We investigated the possibility to identify novel small molecule ligands with pre-deﬁned binding proﬁles for a series of kinase targets and anti-targets by in silico docking. The candidate ligands originating from these calculations were assayed to determine their experimental binding proﬁles. Compared to previous studies, the acquired hit rates were low in this speciﬁc setup, which aimed at not only selecting multi-target kinase ligands, but also designing out binding to anti-targets. Speciﬁcally, only a single proﬁled substance could be veriﬁed as a sub-micromolar, dual-speciﬁc EGFR/ErbB2 ligand that indeed avoided its selected anti-target BRAF. We subsequently re-analyzed our target choice and in silico strategy based on these ﬁndings, with a particular emphasis on the hit rates that can be expected from a given target combination. To that end, we supplemented the structure-based docking calculations with bioinformatic considerations of binding pocket sequence and structure similarity as well as ligand-centric comparisons of kinases. Taken together, our results provide a multi-faceted picture of how pocket space can determine the success of docking in multitarget drug discovery efforts.},

	abstract = {Background:  Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for large molecules such as peptides. However, no available finger‑print achieves good performance on both classes of molecules.
Results:  Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of r = 1 and r = 2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the result‑ing set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\% of which are indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.
Conclusion:  MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space. The source code is available at https://githu b.com/reymond-group/map4 and interactive MAP4 similarity search tools and TMAPs for various databases are acces‑sible at http://map-search.gdb.tools/ and http://tm.gdb.tools/map4/.},

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

After this wealth of data, a new generation of data-driven descriptors has arisen providing a rich portrait of small molecule characteristics that goes beyond chemical properties. Here, we give an overview of biologically relevant descriptors, covering chemical compounds, proteins and other biological entities, such as diseases and cell lines, while aligning them to the major contributions in the field from disciplines, such as natural language processing or computer vision. We now envision a new scenario for chemical and biological entities where they both are translated into a common numerical format. In this computational framework, complex connections between entities can be unveiled by means of simple arithmetic operations, such as distance measures, additions, and subtractions.},

As a result of his enthusiasm and scientific abilities, dedication, and contacts with other scientists of his time, he was able to make countless contributions in fields as diverse as histology, haematology, immunology, oncology, microbiology and pharmacology, among others. Although the Swedish award was meant to recognize the standardization of the manufacture of antidiphtheria serum, it was the discovery of arsphenamine (Salvarsan) for the treatment of syphilis which won him wider international acclaim. From a pharmacological perspective, Ehrlich’s outstanding contributions include dissemination of the ‘magic bullet’ concept for the synthesis of antibacterials, introduction of concepts such as chemoreceptor and chemotherapy, and linking the chemical structure of compounds to their pharmacological activity. These achievements took place within the framework he established for the transition from experimental pharmacology to therapeutic pharmacology. He introduced a modern research system based on the synthesis of multiple chemical structures for pharmacological screening in animal models of disease states. These contributions were undoubtedly decisive in propitiating the wider development of antibiotics decades later. For these reasons, it is fitting to mark the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prize awarded to this great scientist by commemorating the importance of his contributions to the advance of pharmacology.},

	abstract = {Quinine remains an important anti-malarial drug almost 400 years after its effectiveness was first documented. However, its continued use is challenged by its poor tolerability, poor compliance with complex dosing regimens, and the availability of more efficacious anti-malarial drugs. This article reviews the historical role of quinine, considers its current usage and provides insight into its appropriate future use in the treatment of malaria. In light of recent research findings intravenous artesunate should be the first-line drug for severe malaria, with quinine as an alternative. The role of rectal quinine as pre-referral treatment for severe malaria has not been fully explored, but it remains a promising intervention. In pregnancy, quinine continues to play a critical role in the management of malaria, especially in the first trimester, and it will remain a mainstay of treatment until safer alternatives become available. For uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) offers a better option than quinine though the difficulty of maintaining a steady supply of ACT in resource-limited settings renders the rapid withdrawal of quinine for uncomplicated malaria cases risky. The best approach would be to identify solutions to ACT stock-outs, maintain quinine in case of ACT stock-outs, and evaluate strategies for improving quinine treatment outcomes by combining it with antibiotics. In HIV and TB infected populations, concerns about potential interactions between quinine and antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis drugs exist, and these will need further research and pharmacovigilance.},

            The diversity of distinct covalent forms of proteins (the proteome) greatly exceeds the number of proteins predicted by DNA coding capacities owing to directed posttranslational modifications. Enzymes dedicated to such protein modifications include 500 human protein kinases, 150 protein phosphatases, and 500 proteases. The major types of protein covalent modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation, can be classified according to the type of amino acid side chain modified, the category of the modifying enzyme, and the extent of reversibility. Chemical events such as protein splicing, green fluorescent protein maturation, and proteasome autoactivations also represent posttranslational modifications. An understanding of the scope and pattern of the many posttranslational modifications in eukaryotic cells provides insight into the function and dynamics of proteome compositions.},

	abstract = {Background: All living organisms are made of individual and identifiable cells, whose number, together with their size and type, ultimately defines the structure and functions of an organism. While the total cell number of lower organisms is often known, it has not yet been defined in higher organisms. In particular, the reported total cell number of a human being ranges between 1012 and 1016 and it is widely mentioned without a proper reference. Aim: To study and discuss the theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose the standard human adult organism. Subjects and methods: A systematic calculation of the total cell number of the whole human body and of the single organs was carried out using bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches.
Results: A current estimation of human total cell number calculated for a variety of organs and cell types is presented. These partial data correspond to a total number of 3.72 Â 1013.
Conclusions: Knowing the total cell number of the human body as well as of individual organs is important from a cultural, biological, medical and comparative modelling point of view. The presented cell count could be a starting point for a common effort to complete the total calculation.},

	abstract = {Cell size and cell count are adaptively regulated and intimately linked to growth and function. Yet, despite their widespread relevance, the relation between cell size and count has never been formally examined over the whole human body. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of cell size and count over all major cell types, with data drawn from {\textgreater}1,500 published sources. We consider the body of a representative male (70 kg), which allows further estimates of a female (60 kg) and 10-y-old child (32 kg). We build a hierarchical interface for the cellular organization of the body, giving easy access to data, methods, and sources (
              https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/
              ). In total, we estimate total body counts of ≈36 trillion cells in the male, ≈28 trillion in the female, and ≈17 trillion in the child. These data reveal a surprising inverse relation between cell size and count, implying a trade-off between these variables, such that all cells within a given logarithmic size class contribute an equal fraction to the body’s total cellular biomass. We also find that the coefficient of variation is approximately independent of mean cell size, implying the existence of cell-size regulation across cell types. Our data serve to establish a holistic quantitative framework for the cells of the human body, and highlight large-scale patterns in cell biology.},

Recent advances in single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (scRNAseq and snRNA-seq) provides the possibility of profiling the molecular and cellular characteristics of heart cells. We collected scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data of healthy human hearts from all available sources and built the first human ensemble heart cell atlas, uniHEART, using a unified information framework for cell-centric atlas assembly. The current version of uniHEART contains 1,025,739 cells from 65 human heart samples, covering 19 major cell types in adult and developing human heart. The samples are from 10 anatomic regions of the heart, with age of the donors ranging from 5 weeks of the fetus to 75 years old. With this ensemble cell atlas, we constructed the multifaceted cellular and molecular portraits of the human heart by its anatomic parts, cell types and interactions, gene expression and networks. A rich interactive portraiture web system is provided for users to explore the atlas. With uniHEART, we discovered the molecular changes in the heart endothelial cells during aging and explored the disease therapeutic target celltypes. These case examples showed that uniHEART provides a holographic cellular reference for future studies on the human heart.},

To date, large-scale investigations into the pattern of transcript expression across distinct tissues have produced contradictory results. Here, we attempt to determine whether genes express a dominant splice variant at the protein level. We interrogate peptides from eight large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases and ﬁnd that there is a single dominant protein isoform, irrespective of tissue or cell type, for the vast majority of the protein-coding genes in these experiments, in partial agreement with the conclusions from the most recent large-scale RNAseq study. Remarkably, the dominant isoforms from the experimental proteomics analyses coincided overwhelmingly with the reference isoforms selected by two completely orthogonal sources, the consensus coding sequence variants, which are agreed upon by separate manual genome curation teams, and the principal isoforms from the APPRIS database, predicted automatically from the conservation of protein sequence, structure, and function.},

The novel scaﬀolds retain the biological relevance of natural products but are not obtainable through known biosynthetic pathways which can lead to new chemotypes that may have unexpected or unprecedented bioactivities.

Owing to its action at multiple receptor sites, propranolol exerts several central and peripheral effects and is therefore useful in various conditions. Right from reduction in postmyocardial mortality to control of anxiety in performers, propranolol plays an important role in a plethora of medical conditions. Interestingly, even today, newer indications of this age‑old drug are being discovered. Moreover, propranolol treatment has been found to be cost‑effective when compared to other corresponding treatment options for individual indications. In this article, we attempt to recount the journey of propranolol right from its inception to the present day.},

	abstract = {This section discusses the rationale and ethical rules governing donor selection to ensure ethnic and gender diversity along with the methodologies for DNA extraction and library construction. The plasmid library construction is the first critical step in shotgun sequencing. If the DNA libraries are not uniform in size, nonchimeric, and do not randomly represent the genome, then the subsequent steps cannot accurately reconstruct the genome sequence. We used automated high-throughput DNA sequencing and the computational infrastructure to enable efficient tracking of enormous amounts of sequence information (27.3 million sequence reads; 14.9 billion bp of sequence). Sequencing and tracking from both ends of plasmid clones from 2-, 10-, and 50-kbp libraries were essential to the computational reconstruction of the genome. Our evidence indicates that the accurate pairing rate of end sequences was greater than 98\%.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the research and development investment required to bring a new therapeutic agent to market, using publicly available data. DESIGN AND SETTING Data were analyzed on new therapeutic agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2009 and 2018 to estimate the research and development expenditure required to bring a new medicine to market. Data were accessed from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Drugs@FDA database, and ClinicalTrials.gov, alongside published data on clinical trial success rates. EXPOSURES Conduct of preclinical and clinical studies of new therapeutic agents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Median and mean research and development spending on new therapeutic agents approved by the FDA, capitalized at a real cost of capital rate (the required rate of return for an investor) of 10.5\% per year, with bootstrapped CIs. All amounts were reported in 2018 US dollars.
RESULTS The FDA approved 355 new drugs and biologics over the study period. Research and development expenditures were available for 63 (18\%) products, developed by 47 different companies. After accounting for the costs of failed trials, the median capitalized research and development investment to bring a new drug to market was estimated at \$1141.7 million (95\% CI, \$888.1 million-\$1480.8 million), and the mean investment was estimated at \$1559.1 million (95\% CI, \$1271.0 million-\$1893.8 million) in the base case analysis. Median estimates by therapeutic area (for areas with Ն5 drugs) ranged from \$765.9 million (95\% CI, \$323.0 million-\$1473.5 million) for nervous system agents to \$2771.6 million (95\% CI, \$2051.8 million-\$5366.2 million) for antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. Data were mainly accessible for smaller firms, orphan drugs, products in certain therapeutic areas, first-in-class drugs, therapeutic agents that received accelerated approval, and products approved between 2014 and 2018. Results varied in sensitivity analyses using different estimates of clinical trial success rates, preclinical expenditures, and cost of capital.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides an estimate of research and development costs for new therapeutic agents based on publicly available data. Differences from previous studies may reflect the spectrum of products analyzed, the restricted availability of data in the public domain, and differences in underlying assumptions in the cost calculations.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this economic evaluation study, an analytical model of drug development constructed using public and proprietary sources that collectively cover data from 2000 to 2018 was used to estimate the cost of bringing a drug to market, overall and for specific therapeutic classes. The analysis for the study was completed in October 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three measures of development cost from nonclinical through postmarketing stages were estimated: mean out-of-pocket cost or cash outlay, mean expected cost, and mean expected capitalized cost. Pharmaceutical R\&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R\&D spending to total sales, from 2008 to 2019, based on the time frame for available data, was also analyzed.
RESULTS The estimated mean cost of developing a new drug was approximately \$172.7 million (2018 dollars) (range, \$72.5 million for genitourinary to \$297.2 million for pain and anesthesia), inclusive of postmarketing studies. The cost increased to \$515.8 million when cost of failures was included. When the costs of failures and capital were included, the mean expected capitalized cost of drug development increased to \$879.3 million (range, \$378.7 million for anti-infectives to \$1756.2 million for pain and anesthesia); results varied widely by therapeutic class. The pharmaceutical industry as a whole experienced a decline of 15.6\% in sales but increased R\&D intensity from 11.9\% to 17.7\% from 2008 to 2019. By contrast, R\&D intensity of large pharmaceutical companies increased from 16.6\% to 19.3\%, whereas sales increased by 10.0\% (from \$380.0 to \$418.0 billion) over the same 2008 to 2019 period, even though the cost of drug development remained relatively stable or may have even decreased.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this economic evaluation of new drug development costs, even though the cost of drug development appears to have remained stable, R\&D intensity of large pharmaceutical companies remained relatively unchanged, despite substantial growth in revenues during this period. These findings can inform the design of drug-related policies and their potential impacts on innovation and competition.},

	abstract = {Ninety percent of clinical drug development fails despite implementation of many successful strategies, which raised the question whether certain aspects in target validation and drug optimization are overlooked? Current drug optimization overly emphasizes potency/speciﬁcity using structure‒activityrelationship (SAR) but overlooks tissue exposure/selectivity in disease/normal tissues using structure‒tissue exposure/selectivityerelationship (STR), which may mislead the drug candidate selection and impact the balance of clinical dose/efﬁcacy/toxicity. We propose structure‒tissue exposure/selectivityeactivity relationship (STAR) to improve drug optimization, which classiﬁes drug candidates based on drug’s potency/selectivity, tissue exposure/selectivity, and required dose for balancing clinical efﬁcacy/toxicity. Class I drugs have high speciﬁcity/potency and high tissue exposure/selectivity, which needs low dose to achieve superior clinical efﬁcacy/safety with high success rate. Class II drugs have high speciﬁcity/potency and low tissue exposure/selectivity, which requires high dose to achieve clinical efﬁcacy with high toxicity and needs to be cautiously evaluated. Class III drugs have relatively low (adequate) speciﬁcity/ potency but high tissue exposure/selectivity, which requires low dose to achieve clinical efﬁcacy with manageable toxicity but are often overlooked. Class IV drugs have low speciﬁcity/potency and low tissue exposure/selectivity, which achieves inadequate efﬁcacy/safety, and should be terminated early. STAR may improve drug optimization and clinical studies for the success of clinical drug development.},

The space navigation is accomplished within minutes on aﬀordable standard computer hardware using a tree-based molecule descriptor and dynamic programming. Maximizing the synthetic accessibility of the results from the computer is achieved by applying a careful selection of building blocks in combination with suitably chosen reactions; a decade of in-house quality control shows that this is a crucial part in the process. The REAL Space is the largest chemical space of commercially available compounds, counting 11 billion molecules as of today. It was used to mine actives against bromodomain 4 (BRD4). Before synthesis, compounds were docked into the binding site using a scoring function, which incorporates intrinsic desolvation terms, thus avoiding time-consuming simulations. Five micromolar hits have been identiﬁed and veriﬁed within less than six weeks, including the measurement of IC50 values. We conclude that this procedure is a substantial time-saver, accelerating both ligand and structure-based approaches in hit generation and lead optimization stages.},

The strategy is based on the use of two- or three-step three-component reaction sequences and available starting materials with pre-validated chemical reactivity. After the preliminary parallel experiments, the methods with at least \$80\% synthesis success rate (such as acylation – deprotection – acylation of monoprotected diamines or amide formation –click reaction with functionalized azides) can be selected and used to generate the target chemical space. It is shown that by using only on the two aforementioned reaction sequences, a nearly 29-billion compound library is easily obtained. According to the predicted physico-chemical descriptor values, the generated chemical space contains large fractions of both drug-like and ‘‘beyond ruleof-ﬁve’’ members, whereas the strictest lead-likeness criteria (the so-called Churcher’s rules) are met by the lesser part, which still exceeds 22 million.},

We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials.

	abstract = {Background: In spite of many years of research, our understanding of the molecular bases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is still incomplete, and the medical treatments available mainly target the disease symptoms and are hardly effective. Indeed, the modulation of a single target (e.g., β-secretase) has proven to be insufficient to significantly alter the physiopathology of the disease, and we should therefore move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic strategies, where AD-related changes are modulated globally. Methods: Here we present the complete characterization of three murine models of AD at different stages of the disease (i.e., onset, progression and advanced). We combined the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses and full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling of the hippocampus. Additionally, we derived specific Aβ-related molecular AD signatures and looked for drugs able to globally revert them. Results: We found that AD models show accelerated aging and that factors specifically associated with Aβ pathology are involved. We discovered a few proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding transcript levels remain stable, and showed that at least two of them (i.e., lfit3 and Syt11) co-localize with Aβ plaques in the brain. Finally, we found two NSAIDs (dexketoprofen and etodolac) and two antihypertensives (penbutolol and bendroflumethiazide) that overturn the cognitive impairment in AD mice while reducing Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and partially restoring the physiological levels of AD signature genes to wild-type levels.},

	abstract = {Molecular similarity is a key concept in drug discovery. It is based on the assumption that structurally similar molecules frequently have similar properties. Assessment of similarity between small molecules has been highly effective in the discovery and development of various drugs. Especially, two-dimensional (2D) similarity approaches have been quite popular due to their simplicity, accuracy and efﬁciency. Recently, the focus has been shifted toward the development of methods involving the representation and comparison of three-dimensional (3D) conformation of small molecules. Among the 3D similarity methods, evaluation of shape similarity is now gaining attention for its application not only in virtual screening but also in molecular target prediction, drug repurposing and scaffold hopping. A wide range of methods have been developed to describe molecular shape and to determine the shape similarity between small molecules. The most widely used methods include atom distance-based methods, surface-based approaches such as spherical harmonics and 3D Zernike descriptors, atom-centered Gaussian overlay based representations. Several of these methods demonstrated excellent virtual screening performance not only retrospectively but also prospectively. In addition to methods assessing the similarity between small molecules, shape similarity approaches have been developed to compare shapes of protein structures and binding pockets. Additionally, shape comparisons between atomic models and 3D density maps allowed the ﬁtting of atomic models into cryo-electron microscopy maps. This review aims to summarize the methodological advances in shape similarity assessment highlighting advantages, disadvantages and their application in drug discovery.},

To date, about 100,000 compounds and 50,000 natural product extracts have been screened. Early in this program it was discovered that the pattern of growth inhibition in these cell lines was similar for compounds of similar mechanism. The development of the COMPARE algorithm provided a means by which investigators, starting with a compound of interest, could identify other compounds whose pattern of growth inhibition was similar. With extensive molecular characterization of these cell lines, COMPARE and other user-defined algorithms have been used to link patterns of molecular expression and drug sensitivity. We describe here the results of screening current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer agents in the NCI60 screen, with an emphasis on those agents that target signal transduction. We analyzed results from agents with mechanisms of action presumed to be similar; we also carried out a hierarchical clustering of all of these agents. The addition of data from recently approved anticancer agents will increase the utility of the NCI60 databases to the cancer research community. These data are freely accessible to the public on the DTP website (http://dtp.cancer.gov/).

            Identifying genetic alterations that prime a cancer cell to respond to a particular therapeutic agent can facilitate the development of precision cancer medicines. Cancer cell-line (CCL) profiling of small-molecule sensitivity has emerged as an unbiased method to assess the relationships between genetic or cellular features of CCLs and small-molecule response. Here, we developed annotated cluster multidimensional enrichment analysis to explore the associations between groups of small molecules and groups of CCLs in a new, quantitative sensitivity dataset. This analysis reveals insights into small-molecule mechanisms of action, and genomic features that associate with CCL response to small-molecule treatment. We are able to recapitulate known relationships between FDA-approved therapies and cancer dependencies and to uncover new relationships, including for KRAS-mutant cancers and neuroblastoma. To enable the cancer community to explore these data, and to generate novel hypotheses, we created an updated version of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal (CTRP v2).
            Significance: We present the largest CCL sensitivity dataset yet available, and an analysis method integrating information from multiple CCLs and multiple small molecules to identify CCL response predictors robustly. We updated the CTRP to enable the cancer research community to leverage these data and analyses. Cancer Discov; 5(11); 1210–23. ©2015 AACR.

	abstract = {Since the advent of high-throughput screening (HTS), there has been an urgent need for methods that facilitate the interrogation of large-scale chemical biology data to build a mode of action (MoA) hypothesis. This can be done either prior to the HTS by subset design of compounds with known MoA or post HTS by data annotation and mining. To enable this process, we developed a tool that compares compounds solely on the basis of their bioactivity: the chemical biological descriptor “high-throughput screening ﬁngerprint” (HTS-FP). In the current embodiment, data are aggregated from 195 biochemical and cell-based assays developed at Novartis and can be used to identify bioactivity relationships among the in-house collection comprising ∼1.5 million compounds. We demonstrate the value of the HTS-FP for virtual screening and in particular scaﬀold hopping. HTS-FP outperforms state of the art methods in several aspects, retrieving bioactive compounds with remarkable chemical dissimilarity to a probe structure. We also apply HTS-FP for the design of screening subsets in HTS. Using retrospective data, we show that a biodiverse selection of plates performs signiﬁcantly better than a chemically diverse selection of plates, both in terms of number of hits and diversity of chemotypes retrieved. This is also true in the case of hit expansion predictions using HTS-FP similarity. Sets of compounds clustered with HTS-FP are biologically meaningful, in the sense that these clusters enrich for genes and gene ontology (GO) terms, showing that compounds that are bioactively similar also tend to target proteins that operate together in the cell. HTS-FP are valuable not only because of their predictive power but mainly because they relate compounds solely on the basis of bioactivity, harnessing the accumulated knowledge of a high-throughput screening facility toward the understanding of how compounds interact with the proteome.},

              Genome-wide identification of all target proteins of drug candidate compounds is a challenging issue in drug discovery. Moreover, emerging phenotypic effects, including therapeutic and adverse effects, are heavily dependent on the inhibition or activation of target proteins. Here we propose a novel computational method for predicting inhibitory and activatory targets of drug candidate compounds. Specifically, we integrated chemically-induced and genetically-perturbed gene expression profiles in human cell lines, which avoided dependence on chemical structures of compounds or proteins. Predictive models for individual target proteins were simultaneously constructed by the joint learning algorithm based on transcriptomic changes in global patterns of gene expression profiles following chemical treatments, and following knock-down and over-expression of proteins. This method discriminates between inhibitory and activatory targets and enables accurate identification of therapeutic effects. Herein, we comprehensively predicted drug–target–disease association networks for 1,124 drugs, 829 target proteins, and 365 human diseases, and validated some of these predictions
              in vitro
              . The proposed method is expected to facilitate identification of new drug indications and potential adverse effects.},

              The decreasing cost of genomic technologies has enabled the molecular characterization of large-scale clinical disease samples and of molecular changes upon drug treatment in various disease models. Exploring methods to relate diseases to potentially efficacious drugs through various molecular features is critically important in the discovery of new therapeutics. Here we show that the potency of a drug to reverse cancer-associated gene expression changes positively correlates with that drug’s efficacy in preclinical models of breast, liver and colon cancers. Using a systems-based approach, we predict four compounds showing high potency to reverse gene expression in liver cancer and validate that all four compounds are effective in five liver cancer cell lines. The
              in vivo
              efficacy of pyrvinium pamoate is further confirmed in a subcutaneous xenograft model. In conclusion, this systems-based approach may be complementary to the traditional target-based approach in connecting diseases to potentially efficacious drugs.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-15-79},
	abstract = {Background: Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) is a fundamental step in studies that perform genome wide expression profiling. Typically, DEG are identified by univariate approaches such as Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) or Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) for processing cDNA microarrays, and differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution (DESeq) or Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression data in R (edgeR) for RNA-seq profiling.
Results: Here we present a new geometrical multivariate approach to identify DEG called the Characteristic Direction. We demonstrate that the Characteristic Direction method is significantly more sensitive than existing methods for identifying DEG in the context of transcription factor (TF) and drug perturbation responses over a large number of microarray experiments. We also benchmarked the Characteristic Direction method using synthetic data, as well as RNA-Seq data. A large collection of microarray expression data from TF perturbations (73 experiments) and drug perturbations (130 experiments) extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as an RNA-Seq study that profiled genome-wide gene expression and STAT3 DNA binding in two subtypes of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, were used for benchmarking the method using real data. ChIP-Seq data identifying DNA binding sites of the perturbed TFs, as well as known drug targets of the perturbing drugs, were used as prior knowledge silver-standard for validation. In all cases the Characteristic Direction DEG calling method outperformed other methods. We find that when drugs are applied to cells in various contexts, the proteins that interact with the drug-targets are differentially expressed and more of the corresponding genes are discovered by the Characteristic Direction method. In addition, we show that the Characteristic Direction conceptualization can be used to perform improved gene set enrichment analyses when compared with the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the hypergeometric test.
Conclusions: The application of the Characteristic Direction method may shed new light on relevant biological mechanisms that would have remained undiscovered by the current state-of-the-art DEG methods. The method is freely accessible via various open source code implementations using four popular programming languages: R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica, all available at: http://www.maayanlab.net/CD.},

	abstract = {The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that can mediate the interaction of the human host with their environment. The interaction between gut microbes and commonly used non-­antibiotic drugs is complex and bidirectional: gut microbiome composition can be influenced by drugs, but, vice versa, the gut microbiome can also influence an individual’s response to a drug by enzymatically transforming the drug’s structure and altering its bioavailability, bioactivity or toxicity (pharmacomicrobiomics). The gut microbiome can also indirectly impact an individual’s response to immunotherapy in cancer treatment. In this review we discuss the bidirectional interactions between microbes and drugs, describe the changes in gut microbiota induced by commonly used non-a­ ntibiotic drugs, and their potential clinical consequences and summarise how the microbiome impacts drug effectiveness and its role in immunotherapy. Understanding how the microbiome metabolises drugs and reduces treatment efficacy will unlock the possibility of modulating the gut microbiome to improve treatment.},

The advent of molecular biology and, in particular, of genomic sciences is having a deep impact on drug discovery. Recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies have greatly enriched our therapeutic armamentarium. Genome sciences, combined with bioinformatic tools, allow us to dissect the genetic basis of multifactorial diseases and to determine the most suitable points of attack for future medicines, thereby increasing the number of treatment options. The dramatic increase in the complexity of drug research is enforcing changes in the institutional basis of this interdisciplinary endeavor. The biotech industry is establishing itself as the discovery arm of the pharmaceutical industry. In bridging the gap between academia and large pharmaceutical companies, the biotech firms have been effective instruments of technology transfer.},

Computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools can act as a virtual shortcut, assisting in the expedition of this long process and potentially reducing the cost of research and development. Today CADD has become an effective and indispensable tool in therapeutic development. The human genome project has made available a substantial amount of sequence data that can be used in various drug discovery projects. Additionally, increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as increasing computer power have made it possible to use computational methods effectively in various phases of the drug discovery and development pipeline. The importance of in silico tools is greater than ever before and has advanced pharmaceutical research. Here we present an overview of computational methods used in different facets of drug discovery and highlight some of the recent successes. In this review, both structure-based and ligand-based drug discovery methods are discussed. Advances in virtual high-throughput screening, protein structure prediction methods, protein–ligand docking, pharmacophore modeling and QSAR techniques are reviewed.},

            The technological advances of the past century, marked by the computer revolution and the advent of high-throughput screening technologies in drug discovery, opened the path to the computational analysis and visualization of bioactive molecules. For this purpose, it became necessary to represent molecules in a syntax that would be readable by computers and understandable by scientists of various fields. A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. We present here some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in drug discovery, many of which are based on graph representations. Furthermore, we describe applications of these representations in AI-driven drug discovery. Our aim is to provide a brief guide on structural representations that are essential to the practice of AI in drug discovery. This review serves as a guide for researchers who have little experience with the handling of chemical representations and plan to work on applications at the interface of these fields.},

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the diﬀerent kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory.},

We propose a variational autoencoder model in which both encoder and decoder are graphstructured. Our decoder assumes a sequential ordering of graph extension steps and we discuss and analyze design choices that mitigate the potential downsides of this linearization. Experiments compare our approach with a wide range of baselines on the molecule generation task and show that our method is successful at matching the statistics of the original dataset on semantically important metrics. Furthermore, we show that by using appropriate shaping of the latent space, our model allows us to design molecules that are (locally) optimal in desired properties.},

          , 
            Molecular machine learning has been maturing rapidly over the last few years. Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.},

              Genome-wide identification of all target proteins of drug candidate compounds is a challenging issue in drug discovery. Moreover, emerging phenotypic effects, including therapeutic and adverse effects, are heavily dependent on the inhibition or activation of target proteins. Here we propose a novel computational method for predicting inhibitory and activatory targets of drug candidate compounds. Specifically, we integrated chemically-induced and genetically-perturbed gene expression profiles in human cell lines, which avoided dependence on chemical structures of compounds or proteins. Predictive models for individual target proteins were simultaneously constructed by the joint learning algorithm based on transcriptomic changes in global patterns of gene expression profiles following chemical treatments, and following knock-down and over-expression of proteins. This method discriminates between inhibitory and activatory targets and enables accurate identification of therapeutic effects. Herein, we comprehensively predicted drug–target–disease association networks for 1,124 drugs, 829 target proteins, and 365 human diseases, and validated some of these predictions
              in vitro
              . The proposed method is expected to facilitate identification of new drug indications and potential adverse effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Since the early 1990s the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has utilized a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines (NCI60) representing 9 tissue types to screen for potential new anticancer agents. To date, about 100,000 compounds and 50,000 natural product extracts have been screened. Early in this program it was discovered that the pattern of growth inhibition in these cell lines was similar for compounds of similar mechanism. The development of the COMPARE algorithm provided a means by which investigators, starting with a compound of interest, could identify other compounds whose pattern of growth inhibition was similar. With extensive molecular characterization of these cell lines, COMPARE and other user-defined algorithms have been used to link patterns of molecular expression and drug sensitivity. We describe here the results of screening current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer agents in the NCI60 screen, with an emphasis on those agents that target signal transduction. We analyzed results from agents with mechanisms of action presumed to be similar; we also carried out a hierarchical clustering of all of these agents. The addition of data from recently approved anticancer agents will increase the utility of the NCI60 databases to the cancer research community. These data are freely accessible to the public on the DTP website (http://dtp.cancer.gov/). The FDA-approved anticancer agents are themselves available from the NCI as a plated set of compounds for research use. Mol Cancer Ther; 9(5); 1451–60. ©2010 AACR.},

We used phenotypic side-effect similarities to infer whether two drugs share a target. Applied to 746 marketed drugs, a network of 1018 side effect–driven drug-drug relations became apparent, 261 of which are formed by chemically dissimilar drugs from different therapeutic indications. We experimentally tested 20 of these unexpected drug-drug relations and validated 13 implied drug-target relations by in vitro binding assays, of which 11 reveal inhibition constants equal to less than 10 micromolar. Nine of these were tested and confirmed in cell assays, documenting the feasibility of using phenotypic information to infer molecular interactions and hinting at new uses of marketed drugs.},

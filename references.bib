            In the recent years, the improvement of software and hardware performance has made biomolecular simulations a mature tool for the study of biological processes. Simulation length and the size and complexity of the analyzed systems make simulations both complementary and compatible with other bioinformatics disciplines. However, the characteristics of the software packages used for simulation have prevented the adoption of the technologies accepted in other bioinformatics fields like automated deployment systems, workflow orchestration, or the use of software containers. We present here a comprehensive exercise to bring biomolecular simulations to the “bioinformatics way of working”. The exercise has led to the development of the BioExcel Building Blocks (BioBB) library. BioBB’s are built as Python wrappers to provide an interoperable architecture. BioBB’s have been integrated in a chain of usual software management tools to generate data ontologies, documentation, installation packages, software containers and ways of integration with workflow managers, that make them usable in most computational environments.},

	abstract = {Background: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendorneutral formats.
Results: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.
Conclusions: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

	abstract = {Background: Detecting similar ligand-binding sites in globally unrelated proteins has a wide range of applications in modern drug discovery, including drug repurposing, the prediction of side effects, and drug-target interactions. Although a number of techniques to compare binding pockets have been developed, this problem still poses significant challenges.
Results: We evaluate the performance of three algorithms to calculate similarities between ligand-binding sites, APoc, SiteEngine, and G-LoSA. Our assessment considers not only the capabilities to identify similar pockets and to construct accurate local alignments, but also the dependence of these alignments on the sequence order. We point out certain drawbacks of previously compiled datasets, such as the inclusion of structurally similar proteins, leading to an overestimated performance. To address these issues, a rigorous procedure to prepare unbiased, high-quality benchmarking sets is proposed. Further, we conduct a comparative assessment of techniques directly aligning binding pockets to indirect strategies employing structure-based virtual screening with AutoDock Vina and rDock.
Conclusions: Thorough benchmarks reveal that G-LoSA offers a fairly robust overall performance, whereas the accuracy of APoc and SiteEngine is satisfactory only against easy datasets. Moreover, combining various algorithms into a meta-predictor improves the performance of existing methods to detect similar binding sites in unrelated proteins by 5–10\%.

	abstract = {The binding of drugs and reagents to oﬀ-targets is well-known. Whereas many oﬀ-targets are related to the primary target by sequence and fold, many ligands bind to unrelated pairs of proteins, and these are harder to anticipate. If the binding site in the oﬀ-target can be related to that of the primary target, this challenge resolves into aligning the two pockets. However, other cases are possible: the ligand might interact with entirely diﬀerent residues and environments in the oﬀ-target, or wholly diﬀerent ligand atoms may be implicated in the two complexes. To investigate these scenarios at atomic resolution, the structures of 59 ligands in 116 complexes (62 pairs in total), where the protein pairs were unrelated by fold but bound an identical ligand, were examined. In almost half of the pairs, the ligand interacted with unrelated residues in the two proteins (29 pairs), and in 14 of the pairs wholly diﬀerent ligand moieties were implicated in each complex. Even in those 19 pairs of complexes that presented similar environments to the ligand, ligand superposition rarely resulted in the overlap of related residues. There appears to be no single pattern-matching “code” for identifying binding sites in unrelated proteins that bind identical ligands, though modeling suggests that there might be a limited number of diﬀerent patterns that suﬃce to recognize diﬀerent ligand functional groups.},

              Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort
              1–4
              , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined
              5
              , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences
              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’
              8
              —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years
              9
              . Despite recent progress
              10–14
              , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)
              15
              , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

              Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure
              1
              . Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold
              2
              , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

Various stages of computational and chemical biology research can benefit from this knowledge. The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios. Specific evaluation data sets were developed to shed light on multiple aspects of binding site comparison. An assembly of all applied benchmark sets (ProSPECCTs–Protein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) is made available for the evaluation and optimization of further and still emerging methods.},

	abstract = {Detection of remote binding site similarity in proteins plays an important role for drug repositioning and off-target effect prediction. Various non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and van-derWaals forces drive ligands' molecular recognition by binding sites in proteins. The increasing amount of available structures of protein-small molecule complexes enabled the development of comparative approaches. Several methods have been developed to characterize and compare proteineligand interaction patterns. Usually implemented as ﬁngerprints, these are mainly used for post processing docking scores and (off-)target prediction. In the latter application, interaction proﬁles detect similarities in the bound interactions of different ligands and thus identify essential interactions between a protein and its small molecule ligands. Interaction pattern similarity correlates with binding site similarity and is thus contributing to a higher precision in binding site similarity assessment of proteins with distinct global structure. This renders it valuable for existing drug repositioning approaches in structural bioinformatics. Current methods to characterize and compare structure-based interaction patterns e both for proteinsmall-molecule and proteineprotein interactions e as well as their potential in target prediction will be reviewed in this article. The question of how the set of interaction types, ﬂexibility or water-mediated interactions, inﬂuence the comparison of interaction patterns will be discussed. Due to the wealth of proteineligand structures available today, predicted targets can be ranked by comparing their ligand interaction pattern to patterns of the known target. Such knowledge-based methods offer high precision in comparison to methods comparing whole binding sites based on shape and amino acid physicochemical similarity.},

A novel approach for identification of off-targets by direct superposition of protein binding pocket surfaces is presented and applied to a set of well-studied and highly relevant drug targets, including representative kinases and nuclear hormone receptors. The entire Protein Data Bank is searched for similar binding pockets and convincing distant off-target candidates were identified that share no significant sequence or fold similarity with the respective target structure. These putative target off-target pairs are further supported by the existence of compounds that bind strongly to both with high topological similarity, and in some cases, literature examples of individual compounds that bind to both. Also, our results clearly show that it is possible for binding pockets to exhibit a striking surface similarity, while the respective off-target shares neither significant sequence nor significant fold similarity with the respective molecular target (‘‘distant off-target’’).},

	abstract = {Modern rational drug design not only deals with the search for ligands binding to interesting and promising validated targets but also aims to identify the function and ligands of yet uncharacterized proteins having impact on diﬀerent diseases. Additionally, it contributes to the design of inhibitors with distinct selectivity patterns and the prediction of possible oﬀ-target eﬀects. The identiﬁcation of similarities between binding sites of various proteins is a useful approach to cope with those challenges. The main scope of this perspective is to describe applications of diﬀerent protein binding site comparison approaches to outline their applicability and impact on molecular design. The article deals with various substantial application domains and provides some outstanding examples to show how various binding site comparison methods can be applied to promote in silico drug design workﬂows. In addition, we will also brieﬂy introduce the fundamental principles of diﬀerent protein binding site comparison methods.},

	abstract = {Drug repositioning applies established drugs to new disease indications with increasing success. A pre-requisite for drug repurposing is drug promiscuity (polypharmacology) – a drug’s ability to bind to several targets. There is a long standing debate on the reasons for drug promiscuity. Based on large compound screens, hydrophobicity and molecular weight have been suggested as key reasons. However, the results are sometimes contradictory and leave space for further analysis. Protein structures offer a structural dimension to explain promiscuity: Can a drug bind multiple targets because the drug is flexible or because the targets are structurally similar or even share similar binding sites? We present a systematic study of drug promiscuity based on structural data of PDB target proteins with a set of 164 promiscuous drugs. We show that there is no correlation between the degree of promiscuity and ligand properties such as hydrophobicity or molecular weight but a weak correlation to conformational flexibility. However, we do find a correlation between promiscuity and structural similarity as well as binding site similarity of protein targets. In particular, 71\% of the drugs have at least two targets with similar binding sites. In order to overcome issues in detection of remotely similar binding sites, we employed a score for binding site similarity: LigandRMSD measures the similarity of the aligned ligands and uncovers remote local similarities in proteins. It can be applied to arbitrary structural binding site alignments. Three representative examples, namely the anticancer drug methotrexate, the natural product quercetin and the anti-diabetic drug acarbose are discussed in detail. Our findings suggest that global structural and binding site similarity play a more important role to explain the observed drug promiscuity in the PDB than physicochemical drug properties like hydrophobicity or molecular weight. Additionally, we find ligand flexibility to have a minor influence.},

	abstract = {Interactions between proteins and small molecules are critical for biological functions. These interactions often occur in small cavities within protein structures, known as ligand-binding pockets. Understanding the physicochemical qualities of binding pockets is essential to improve not only our basic knowledge of biological systems, but also drug development procedures. In order to quantify similarities among pockets in terms of their geometries and chemical properties, either bound ligands can be compared to one another or binding sites can be matched directly. Both perspectives routinely take advantage of computational methods including various techniques to represent and compare small molecules as well as local protein structures. In this review, we survey 12 tools widely used to match pockets. These methods are divided into five categories based on the algorithm implemented to construct binding-site alignments. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of their algorithms, test sets and the performance of each method are described. We also discuss general pharmacological applications of computational pocket matching in drug repurposing, polypharmacology and side effects. Reflecting on the importance of these techniques in drug discovery, in the end, we elaborate on the development of more accurate meta-predictors, the incorporation of protein flexibility and the integration of powerful artificial intelligence technologies such as deep learning.},

	abstract = {We herewith present a novel and universal method to convert protein−ligand coordinates into a simple ﬁngerprint of 210 integers registering the corresponding molecular interaction pattern. Each interaction (hydrophobic, aromatic, hydrogen bond, ionic bond, metal complexation) is detected on the ﬂy and physically described by a pseudoatom centered either on the interacting ligand atom, the interacting protein atom, or the geometric center of both interacting atoms. Counting all possible triplets of interaction pseudoatoms within six distance ranges, and pruning the full integer vector to keep the most frequent triplets enables the deﬁnition of a simple (210 integers) and coordinate frame-invariant interaction pattern descriptor (TIFP) that can be applied to compare any pair of protein−ligand complexes. TIFP ﬁngerprints have been calculated for ca. 10 000 druggable protein−ligand complexes therefore enabling a wide comparison of relationships between interaction pattern similarity and ligand or binding site pairwise similarity. We notably show that interaction pattern similarity strongly depends on binding site similarity. In addition to the TIFP ﬁngerprint which registers intermolecular interactions between a ligand and its target protein, we developed two tools (Ishape, Grim) to align protein−ligand complexes from their interaction patterns. Ishape is based on the overlap of interaction pseudoatoms using a smooth Gaussian function, whereas Grim utilizes a standard clique detection algorithm to match interaction pattern graphs. Both tools are complementary and enable protein−ligand complex alignments capitalizing on both global and local pattern similarities. The new ﬁngerprint and companion alignment tools have been successfully used in three scenarios: (i) interaction-biased alignment of protein−ligand complexes, (ii) postprocessing docking poses according to known interaction patterns for a particular target, and (iii) virtual screening for bioisosteric scaﬀolds sharing similar interaction patterns.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-ofthe-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. This is the ﬁrst large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high conﬁdence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.},

	abstract = {The structural comparison of protein binding sites is increasingly important in drug design; identifying structurally similar sites can be useful for techniques such as drug repurposing, and also in a polypharmacological approach to deliberately affect multiple targets in a disease pathway, or to explain unwanted off-target effects. Once similar sites are identified, identifying local differences can aid in the design of selectivity. Such an approach moves away from the classical “one target one drug” approach and toward a wider systems biology paradigm. Here, we report a semiautomated approach, called BioGPS, that is based on the software FLAP which combines GRID Molecular Interactions Fields (MIFs) and pharmacophoric fingerprints. BioGPS comprises the automatic preparation of protein structure data, identification of binding sites, and subsequent comparison by aligning the sites and directly comparing the MIFs. Chemometric approaches are included to reduce the complexity of the resulting data on large datasets, enabling focus on the most relevant information. Individual site similarities can be analyzed in terms of their Pharmacophoric Interaction Field (PIF) similarity, and importantly the differences in their PIFs can be extracted. Here we describe the BioGPS approach, and demonstrate its applicability to rationalize offtarget effects (ERa and SERCA), to classify protein families and explain polypharmacology (ABL1 kinase and NQO2), and to rationalize selectivity between subfamilies (MAP kinases p38a/ERK2 and PPARd/PPARc). The examples shown demonstrate a significant validation of the method and illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

We present KRIPO (Key Representation of Interaction in POckets): a new method for quantifying the similarities of binding site subpockets based on pharmacophore ﬁngerprints. The binding site ﬁngerprints have been optimized to improve their performance for both intra- and interprotein family comparisons. A range of attributes of the ﬁngerprints was considered in the optimization, including the placement of pharmacophore features, whether or not the ﬁngerprints are fuzziﬁed, and the resolution and complexity of the pharmacophore ﬁngerprints (2-, 3-, and 4-point ﬁngerprints). Fuzzy 3-point pharmacophore ﬁngerprints were found to represent the optimal balance between computational resource requirements and the identiﬁcation of potential replacements. The complete PDB was converted into a database comprising almost 300 000 optimized ﬁngerprints of local binding sites together with their associated ligand fragments. The value of the approach is demonstrated by application to two crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank: (1) a MAP kinase P38 structure in complex with a pyridinylimidazole inhibitor (1A9U) and (2) a complex of thrombin with melagatran (1K22). Potentially valuable bioisosteric replacements for all subpockets of the two studied protein are identiﬁed.},

Starting from user-defined ligand binding sites, eight topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages: (i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins is simply done by systematically rotating/ translating one mobile sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties (e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign) and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands with various promiscuity levels. The proposed method is robust enough to detect local similarity among active sites of different sizes, to discriminate between protein subfamilies and to recover the known targets of promiscuous ligands by virtual screening.},

The scoring function can be used to determine the binding mode and site of a ligand, predict binding affinity and identify the potential drug leads for a given protein target. Despite intensive research over the years, accurate and rapid prediction of protein–ligand interactions is still a challenge in molecular docking. For this reason, this study reviews four basic types of scoring functions, physics-based, empirical, knowledgebased, and machine learning-based scoring functions, based on an up-to-date classification scheme. We not only discuss the foundations of the four types scoring functions, suitable application areas and shortcomings, but also discuss challenges and potential future study directions.},

Various virtual screening techniques are now being used by both pharmaceutical companies and academic research groups to reduce the cost and time required for the discovery of a potent drug. Despite the rapid advances in these methods, continuous improvements are critical for future drug discovery tools. Advantages presented by structure-based and ligand-based drug design suggest that their complementary use, as well as their integration with experimental routines, has a powerful impact on rational drug design.

Identiﬁcation of similar binding pockets can help guide eﬀorts for hit-ﬁnding, understanding polypharmacology, and characterization of protein function. The design of pocket matching methods has traditionally involved much intuition and has employed a broad variety of algorithms and representations of the input protein structures. We regard the high heterogeneity of past work and the recent availability of large-scale benchmarks as an indicator that a datadriven approach may provide a new perspective. We propose DeeplyTough, a convolutional neural network that encodes a three-dimensional representation of protein pockets into descriptor vectors that may be compared eﬃciently in an alignment-free manner by computing pairwise Euclidean distances. The network is trained with supervision (i) to provide similar pockets with similar descriptors, (ii) to separate the descriptors of dissimilar pockets by a minimum margin, and (iii) to achieve robustness to nuisance variations. We evaluate our method using three large-scale benchmark datasets, on which it demonstrates excellent performance for held-out data coming from the training distribution and competitive performance when the trained network is required to generalize to datasets constructed independently.

The rapid development of machine learning computational algorithms, coupled with the large volume of publicly available protein−ligand 3D structures, makes it possible to apply deep learning techniques in binding site comparison. Our method uses a cutting-edge spherical convolutional neural network based on the DeepSphere architecture to learn global representations of protein-binding sites. The model was trained on TOUGH-C1 and TOUGH-M1 data and validated with the ProSPECCTs datasets. Our results show that our model can (1) perform well in protein-binding site similarity and classification tasks and (2) learn and separate the physicochemical properties of binding sites. Lastly, we tested the model on a set of kinases, where the results show that it is able to cluster the different kinase subfamilies effectively.

            Biomedical data is accumulating at a fast pace and integrating it into a unified framework is a major challenge, so that multiple views of a given biological event can be considered simultaneously. Here we present the Bioteque, a resource of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., ‘drug treats disease’, ‘gene interacts with gene’). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.},

	abstract = {Many biological activities originate from interactions between small-molecule ligands and their protein targets. A detailed structural and physico-chemical characterization of these interactions could significantly deepen our understanding of protein function and facilitate drug design. Here, we present a large-scale study on a non-redundant set of about 20,000 known ligand-binding sites, or pockets, of proteins. We find that the structural space of protein pockets is crowded, likely complete, and may be represented by about 1,000 pocket shapes. Correspondingly, the growth rate of novel pockets deposited in the Protein Data Bank has been decreasing steadily over the recent years. Moreover, many protein pockets are promiscuous and interact with ligands of diverse scaffolds. Conversely, many ligands are promiscuous and interact with structurally different pockets. Through a physico-chemical and structural analysis, we provide insights into understanding both pocket promiscuity and ligand promiscuity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study for the prediction of protein-ligand interactions based on pocket comparison.},

Under this scenario, there is an urgent need for new approaches to chemically address these yet untargeted proteins. It is widely recognized that the best starting point for generating novel small molecules for proteins is to exploit the expected polypharmacology of known active ligands across phylogenetically related proteins following the paradigm that similar proteins are likely to interact with similar ligands. Here, we introduce a computational strategy to identify privileged structures that, when chemically expanded, are highly probable to contain active small molecules for untargeted proteins. The protocol was first tested on a set of 576 currently targeted proteins having at least one protein family sibling the year before their first active ligand was reported. A privileged structure contained in active ligands that were identified in the following years was correctly anticipated for 214 (37\%) of those targeted proteins, a lower-bound recall estimate when considering data completeness issues. When applied to a set of 1184 untargeted potential druggable genes in cancer, the identification of privileged structures from known bioactive ligands of protein family siblings allowed for extracting a priority list of diverse commercially available small molecules for 960 of them. Assuming a minimum success rate of 37\%, the chemical library selections should be able to deliver active ligands for at least 355 currently untargeted proteins associated with cancer.},

            Medicinal chemistry has discovered thousands of potent protein and lipid kinase inhibitors. These may be developed into therapeutic drugs or chemical probes to study kinase biology. Because of polypharmacology, a large part of the human kinome currently lacks selective chemical probes. To discover such probes, we profiled 1,183 compounds from drug discovery projects in lysates of cancer cell lines using Kinobeads. The resulting 500,000 compound–target interactions are available in ProteomicsDB and we exemplify how this molecular resource may be used. For instance, the data revealed several hundred reasonably selective compounds for 72 kinases. Cellular assays validated GSK986310C as a candidate SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) probe and X-ray crystallography uncovered the structural basis for the observed selectivity of the CK2 inhibitor GW869516X. Compounds targeting PKN3 were discovered and phosphoproteomics identified substrates that indicate target engagement in cells. We anticipate that this molecular resource will aid research in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

            Chemical descriptors encode the physicochemical and structural properties of small molecules, and they are at the core of chemoinformatics. The broad release of bioactivity data has prompted enriched representations of compounds, reaching beyond chemical structures and capturing their known biological properties. Unfortunately, bioactivity descriptors are not available for most small molecules, which limits their applicability to a few thousand well characterized compounds. Here we present a collection of deep neural networks able to infer bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest, even when little or no experimental information is available for them. Our signaturizers relate to bioactivities of 25 different types (including target profiles, cellular response and clinical outcomes) and can be used as drop-in replacements for chemical descriptors in day-to-day chemoinformatics tasks. Indeed, we illustrate how inferred bioactivity signatures are useful to navigate the chemical space in a biologically relevant manner, unveiling higher-order organization in natural product collections, and to enrich mostly uncharacterized chemical libraries for activity against the drug-orphan target Snail1. Moreover, we implement a battery of signature-activity relationship (SigAR) models and show a substantial improvement in performance, with respect to chemistry-based classifiers, across a series of biophysics and physiology activity prediction benchmarks.},

              . used a chemical proteomics approach to map protein-ligand interactions across the human proteome. With a library of around 400 ligand fragments attached to a photoactivatable cross-linker, the authors identified about 50,000 statistically significant interactions over about 2500 proteins, including a large fraction of targets for which there are no prior known ligands. They validated these results with biochemical experiments, identifying from their screen an E3 ligase binder and an inhibitor of a transmembrane transporter. This rich interaction dataset also provided the basis for developing a machine learning model to predict fragment properties and interaction profiles.

              INTRODUCTION
              Chemical modulation of protein function is an important experimental approach to illuminate biological mechanisms and represents the most frequently used strategy to treat human disease. Nevertheless, around 80\% of the human proteome lacks annotated small-molecule ligands, thus leaving many proteins, including validated disease targets, outside the reach of mechanistic elucidation and therapeutic innovation.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              To close this gap, unbiased approaches to advance ligand discovery are urgently needed. We set out to determine the proteome-wide binding preferences of more than 400 small-molecule fragments through a chemoproteomics strategy that is based on treatment of intact cells. With these data at hand, we aimed to (i) identify hundreds of fragment-protein interactions and advance selected fragments toward cell-active ligands, (ii) leverage machine learning (ML) binary classifiers to develop models to predict small-molecule behavior in native biological systems, and (iii) build an interactive open-source interface to empower the broad exploration of the data and of all predictive models.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Through this quantitative chemoproteomics strategy, we experimentally determined the interactome of 407 small-molecule fragments. This led to the identification of 47,658 discrete fragment-protein interactions involving more than 2600 proteins, of which 86\% previously lacked any annotated ligand. To provide evidence for the translational potential of these starting points, we advanced various hits toward elaborated fragments. With focused synthetic efforts, we developed ligands that (i) engage the E3 ligase adaptor protein DDB1, (ii) functionally block the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter SLC29A1 (hENT1), or (iii) selectively inhibit a subset of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), including the orphan CDK16. In addition to advancing individual fragment-protein hits, we leveraged the depth of the global dataset to develop an ML framework to build models that can predict how fragments interact with native proteins on a proteome-wide scale. This framework included inference of quantitative fragment interactomes, which enabled us to predict to how many proteins a given fragment will bind and whether the bound proteins themselves are chemically broadly accessible or otherwise typically refractory to small-molecule ligands. Moreover, ML models allowed us to capture and predict qualitative interactome signatures. This made it possible for us to investigate and predict whether fragments tend to interact with subsets of proteins of coherent function, such as transporters or RNA-binding proteins. Likewise, ML models allowed us to analyze and predict whether fragments tend to interact with groups of proteins that reside in defined subcellular localizations or compartments, such as lysosomes or mitochondria, which can be indicative of intracellular fragment partitioning and accumulation. Last, we have also provided a platform to develop bespoke ML models that are based on a user-defined input of target proteins, and hence enable the prediction of fragment binding to a custom set of proteins.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                Our large-scale chemical proteomics survey led to the identification of hundreds of fragment-protein interactions that are poised for future exploration and chemical optimization. Moreover, we found that the generated data is amenable to ML-based models that enable us to predict how chemical matter interacts with native proteomes in intact cells by using their chemical structure as input. To maximize the practical use for the scientific community, all interactomes, enrichment tools, and ML models have been made publicly available for exploration through a web-based application (
                https://ligand-discovery.ai
                ). Collectively, these data and tools should form a resource to interpret fragment-binding data and expedite ligand discovery efforts.
              
              
                
                  Schematic representation of the ligand discovery approach.
                  Chemoproteomics was used to assess 407 small-molecule fragments. Hundreds of fragment-protein interactions were identified as starting points for probe development. System-level analyses coupled to machine learning enabled prediction of fragment binding and behavior in living cells. An interactive web resource has been provided for data exploration, which also allows the generation and application of bespoke predictive models.},

Here, we constructed the CavitySpace database, the ﬁrst pocket library for all the proteins in the human proteome, using a widely-applied ligand binding site detection program CAVITY. Our analysis showed that known ligand binding sites could be well recovered. We grouped the predicted binding sites according to their similarity which can be used in protein function prediction and drug repurposing studies. Novel binding sites in highly reliable predicted structure regions provide new opportunities for drug discovery.

Small molecule binding sites are assigned druggability scores based on the similarity of their ligands to known drugs, allowing them to be ranked according to their perceived and actual potential for drug development. ProBiS-Fold provides interactive and downloadable binding sites for the entire human structural proteome, including more than 3000 new druggable binding sites that have no corresponding structure in the PDB, taking into account AlphaFold’s model quality, to enable protein structure−function relationship studies and pharmaceutical drug discovery research. The web server is freely accessible to academic users at http://probis-fold.insilab.org.},

While recent innovative deep learning methods for protein structure prediction dramatically increased the structural coverage of the human proteome, molecular interactions remain largely unknown. A new database, HProteome-BSite, provides predictions of binding sites and ligands in the enlarged 3D human proteome. The model structures for human proteins from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database were processed to structural domains of high conﬁdence to maximize the coverage and reliability of interaction prediction. For ligand binding site prediction, an updated version of a template-based method GalaxySite was used. A high-level performance of the updated GalaxySite was conﬁrmed. HProteomeBSite covers 80.74\% of the UniProt entries in the AlphaFold human 3D proteome. Predicted binding sites and binding poses of potential ligands are provided for effective applications to further functional studies and drug discovery.

However, it is unclear if the structures predicted by AlphaFold2 will be valuable targets of docking. To address this question, we redocked ligands in the PDBbind datasets against the experimental co-crystallized receptor structures and against the AlphaFold2 structures using AutoDock-GPU. We find that the quality measure provided during structure prediction is not a good predictor of docking performance, despite accurately reflecting the quality of the alpha carbon alignment with experimental structures. Removing low-confidence regions of the predicted structure and making side chains flexible improves the docking outcomes. Overall, despite high-quality prediction of backbone conformation, fine structural details limit the naive application of AlphaFold2 models as docking targets.},

The open AlphaFold protein structure database covers the complete human proteome. Using an industryleading molecular docking method (Glide), we investigated the virtual screening performance of 37 common drug targets, each with an AF2 structure and known holo and apo structures from the DUD-E data set. In a subset of 27 targets where the AF2 structures are suitable for refinement, the AF2 structures show comparable early enrichment of known active compounds (avg. EF 1\%: 13.0) to apo structures (avg. EF 1\%: 11.4) while falling behind early enrichment of the holo structures (avg. EF 1\%: 24.2). With an induced-fit protocol (IFD-MD), we can refine the AF2 structures using an aligned known binding ligand as the template to improve the performance in structure-based virtual screening (avg. EF 1\%: 18.9). Glide-generated docking poses of known binding ligands can also be used as templates for IFD-MD, achieving similar improvements (avg. EF 1\% 18.0).

Recently, AlphaFold (AF), an artiﬁcial-intelligence-based protein structure prediction method, has shown impressive results in terms of model accuracy. This outstanding success prompted us to evaluate how accurate AF models are from the perspective of docking-based drug discovery. We compared the high-throughput docking (HTD) performance of AF models with their corresponding experimental PDB structures using a benchmark set of 22 targets. The AF models showed consistently worse performance using four docking programs and two consensus techniques. Although AlphaFold shows a remarkable ability to predict protein architecture, this might not be enough to guarantee that AF models can be reliably used for HTD, and post-modeling reﬁnement strategies might be key to increase the chances of success.},

Yet, the inherent complexity of biological systems has fostered the implementation of large-scale experimental screenings seeking a deeper understanding of the targeted proteins, the disrupted biological processes and the systemic responses of cells to chemical perturbations. After this wealth of data, a new generation of data-driven descriptors has arisen providing a rich portrait of small molecule characteristics that goes beyond chemical properties. Here, we give an overview of biologically relevant descriptors, covering chemical compounds, proteins and other biological entities, such as diseases and cell lines, while aligning them to the major contributions in the field from disciplines, such as natural language processing or computer vision. We now envision a new scenario for chemical and biological entities where they both are translated into a common numerical format. In this computational framework, complex connections between entities can be unveiled by means of simple arithmetic operations, such as distance measures, additions, and subtractions.},

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

	abstract = {Background:  Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for large molecules such as peptides. However, no available finger‑print achieves good performance on both classes of molecules.
Results:  Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of r = 1 and r = 2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the result‑ing set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\% of which are indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.
Conclusion:  MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space. The source code is available at https://githu b.com/reymond-group/map4 and interactive MAP4 similarity search tools and TMAPs for various databases are acces‑sible at http://map-search.gdb.tools/ and http://tm.gdb.tools/map4/.},

	abstract = {While selective inhibition is one of the key assets for a small molecule drug, many diseases can only be tackled by simultaneous inhibition of several proteins. An example where achieving selectivity is especially challenging are ligands targeting human kinases. This difﬁculty arises from the high structural conservation of the kinase ATP binding sites, the area targeted by most inhibitors. We investigated the possibility to identify novel small molecule ligands with pre-deﬁned binding proﬁles for a series of kinase targets and anti-targets by in silico docking. The candidate ligands originating from these calculations were assayed to determine their experimental binding proﬁles. Compared to previous studies, the acquired hit rates were low in this speciﬁc setup, which aimed at not only selecting multi-target kinase ligands, but also designing out binding to anti-targets. Speciﬁcally, only a single proﬁled substance could be veriﬁed as a sub-micromolar, dual-speciﬁc EGFR/ErbB2 ligand that indeed avoided its selected anti-target BRAF. We subsequently re-analyzed our target choice and in silico strategy based on these ﬁndings, with a particular emphasis on the hit rates that can be expected from a given target combination. To that end, we supplemented the structure-based docking calculations with bioinformatic considerations of binding pocket sequence and structure similarity as well as ligand-centric comparisons of kinases. Taken together, our results provide a multi-faceted picture of how pocket space can determine the success of docking in multitarget drug discovery efforts.},

            AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RosettaFold have greatly expanded the number of structures available for structure-based ligand discovery, even though retrospective studies have cast doubt on their direct usefulness for that goal. Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models
            prospectively
            , comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In
            retrospective
            docking screens against the σ
            2
            and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors’ experimental structures, consistent with published results.
            Prospective
            large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.},

	abstract = {Background: Virtual screening methods start to be well established as effective approaches to identify hits, candidates and leads for drug discovery research. Among those, structure based virtual screening (SBVS) approaches aim at docking collections of small compounds in the target structure to identify potent compounds. For SBVS, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces.
Results: Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94\% and 92\% of the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the field, while being faster.
Conclusion: Fpocket provides a rapid, open source and stable basis for further developments related to protein pocket detection, efficient pocket descriptor extraction, or drugablity prediction purposes. Fpocket is freely available under the GNU GPL license at http://fpocket.sourceforge.net.},

	abstract = {Background:  Ligand binding site prediction from protein structure has many applications related to elucidation of protein function and structure based drug discovery. It often represents only one step of many in complex computational drug design efforts. Although many methods have been published to date, only few of them are suitable for use in automated pipelines or for processing large datasets. These use cases require stability and speed, which disqualifies many of the recently introduced tools that are either template based or available only as web servers.
Results:  We present P2Rank, a stand-alone template-free tool for prediction of ligand binding sites based on machine learning. It is based on prediction of ligandability of local chemical neighbourhoods that are centered on points placed on the solvent accessible surface of a protein. We show that P2Rank outperforms several existing tools, which include two widely used stand-alone tools (Fpocket, SiteHound), a comprehensive consensus based tool (MetaPocket 2.0), and a recent deep learning based method (DeepSite). P2Rank belongs to the fastest available tools (requires under 1 s for prediction on one protein), with additional advantage of multi-threaded implementation.
Conclusions:  P2Rank is a new open source software package for ligand binding site prediction from protein structure. It is available as a user-friendly stand-alone command line program and a Java library. P2Rank has a lightweight installation and does not depend on other bioinformatics tools or large structural or sequence databases. Thanks to its speed and ability to make fully automated predictions, it is particularly well suited for processing large datasets or as a component of scalable structural bioinformatics pipelines.},

Although oncology is still the predominant area for their application, there have been important approvals for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, and one-t hird of the SMKIs in clinical development address disorders beyond oncology. Information on clinical trials of SMKIs reveals that approximately 110 novel kinases are currently being explored as targets, which together with the approximately 45 targets of approved kinase inhibitors represent only about 30\% of the human kinome, indicating that there are still substantial unexplored opportunities for this drug class.

Four drugs (abrocitinib, baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib) are used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis). Of the 72 approved drugs, eighteen are used in the treatment of multiple diseases. The following three drugs received FDA approval in 2022 for the treatment of these specified diseases: abrocitinib (atopic dermatitis), futibatinib (chol­ angiocarcinomas), pacritinib (myelofibrosis).

              Kinase inhibitors are an important class of drugs that block certain enzymes involved in diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. There are hundreds of kinases within the human body, so knowing the kinase “target” of each drug is essential for developing successful treatment strategies.

              INTRODUCTION
              Molecularly targeted drugs such as imatinib and crizotinib have revolutionized the treatment of certain blood and lung cancers because of their remarkable clinical success. Over the past 20 years, protein kinases have become a major class of drug targets because these signaling biomolecules are often deregulated in disease, particularly in cancer. Today, 37 small kinase inhibitors (KIs) are approved medicines worldwide and more than 250 drug candidates are undergoing clinical evaluation.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Although it is commonly accepted that most KIs target more than one protein, the extent to which this information is available to the public varies greatly between drugs. It would seem important to thoroughly characterize the target spectrum of any drug because additional off-targets may offer opportunities, not only for repurposing but also to explain undesired side effects. To this end, we used a chemical proteomic approach (kinobeads) and quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the target space of 243 clinical KIs that are approved drugs or have been tested in humans.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The number of targets for a given drug differed substantially. Whereas some compounds showed exquisite selectivity, others targeted more than 100 kinases simultaneously, making it difficult to attribute their biological effects to any particular mode of action. Also of note is that recently developed irreversible KIs can address more kinases than their intended targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Collectively, the evaluated KIs targeted 220 kinases with submicromolar affinity, offering a view of the druggable kinome and enabling the development of a universal new selectivity metric termed CATDS (concentration- and target-dependent selectivity). All drug profiles can be interactively explored in ProteomicsDB and a purpose-built shinyApp. Many uses of this unique data and analysis resource by the scientific community can be envisaged, of which we can only highlight a few. The profiles identified many new targets for established drugs, thus improving our understanding of how these drugs might exert their phenotypic effects. For example, we evaluated novel salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) inhibitors for their ability to modulate tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production, which may allow repurposing these drugs for inflammatory conditions. Integrating target space information with phosphoproteomic analysis of several EGFR inhibitors enabled the identification of drug response markers inside and outside the canonical EGFR signaling pathway. Off-target identification may also inform drug discovery projects using high-value clinical molecules as lead compounds. We illustrate such a case by a novel structure-affinity relationship analysis of MELK inhibitors based on target profiles and cocrystal structures. To assess the repurposing potential of approved or clinically advanced compounds, we used cell-based assays and mouse xenografts to show that golvatinib and cabozantinib may be used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on their FLT3 inhibitory activity.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              This work provides a rich data resource describing the target landscape of 243 clinically tested KIs. It is the most comprehensive study to date and illustrates how the information may be used in basic research, drug discovery, or clinical decision-making.
              
                
                  Schematic representation of identifying the druggable kinome.
                  A chemical proteomic approach revealed quantitative interaction profiles of 243 clinically evaluated small-molecule KIs covering half of the human kinome. Results can be interactively explored in ProteomicsDB and inform basic biology, drug discovery, and clinical decision-making.

            Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established drugs, offered a perspective on the “druggable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and drug discovery research and aid clinical decision-making.},

	abstract = {Graph generation techniques are increasingly being adopted for drug discovery. Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their performance degrades signiﬁcantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs signiﬁcantly larger and more ﬂexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a ﬁne-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-ﬁne decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms previous state-ofthe-art baselines.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The algorithm is \$4 times faster than CE and 20 times faster than DALI and SAL. On average, the resulting structure alignments have higher accuracy and coverage than those provided by these most often-used methods. TM-align is applied to an all-against-all structure comparison of 10 515 representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence identity cutoff ,95\%: 1996 distinct folds are found when a TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used. We also use TM-align to match the models predicted by TASSER for solved non-homologous proteins in PDB. For both folded and misfolded models, TMalign can almost always find close structural analogs, with an average root mean square deviation, RMSD, of 3 A˚ and 87\% alignment coverage. Nevertheless, there exists a significant correlation between the correctness of the predicted structure and the structural similarity of the model to the other proteins in the PDB. This correlation could be used to assist in model selection in blind protein structure predictions. The TM-align program is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-align.},

            The increasing volume of biomedical data in chemistry and life sciences requires the development of new methods and approaches for their handling. Here, we briefly discuss some challenges and opportunities of this fast growing area of research with a focus on those to be addressed within the BIGCHEM project. The article starts with a brief description of some available resources for “Big Data” in chemistry and a discussion of the importance of data quality. We then discuss challenges with visualization of millions of compounds by combining chemical and biological data, the expectations from mining the “Big Data” using advanced machine‐learning methods, and their applications in polypharmacology prediction and target de‐convolution in phenotypic screening. We show that the efficient exploration of billions of molecules requires the development of smart strategies. We also address the issue of secure information sharing without disclosing chemical structures, which is critical to enable bi‐party or multi‐party data sharing. Data sharing is important in the context of the recent trend of “open innovation” in pharmaceutical industry, which has led to not only more information sharing among academics and pharma industries but also the so‐called “precompetitive” collaboration between pharma companies. At the end we highlight the importance of education in “Big Data” for further progress of this area.},

	abstract = {Proteins are often enantioselective towards their binding partners. When designing small molecules to interact with these targets, one should consider stereoselectivity. As considerations for exploring structure space evolve, chirality is increasingly important. Binding affinity for a chiral drug can differ for diastereomers and between enantiomers. For the virtual screening and computational design stage of drug development, this problem can be compounded by incomplete stereochemical information in structure libraries leading to a “coin toss” as to whether or not the “ideal” chiral structure is present. Creating every stereoisomer for each chiral compound in a structure library leads to an exponential increase in the number of structures resulting in potentially unmanageable file sizes and screening times. Therefore, only key chiral structures, enantiomeric pairs based on relative stereochemistry need be included, and lead to a compromise between exploration of chemical space and maintaining manageable libraries. In clinical environments, enantiomers of chiral drugs can have reduced, no, or even deleterious effects. This underscores the need to avoid mixtures of compounds and focus on chiral synthesis. Governmental regulations emphasizing the need to monitor chirality in drug development have increased. The United States Food and Drug Administration issued guidelines and policies in 1992 concerning the development of chiral compounds. These guidelines require that absolute stereochemistry be known for compounds with chiral centers and that this information should be established early in drug development in order that the analysis can be considered valid. From exploration of structure space to governmental regulations it is clear that the question of chirality in drug design is of vital importance.},

The exact molecular mechanism by which R-citalopram inhibits the effect of S-citalopram on the serotonin transporter remains to be elucidated. Preliminary evidence indicates an effect of R-citalopram on the association of escitalopram with the high afﬁnity primary site, and on its dissociation from the serotonin transporter, via an allosteric mechanism. Escitalopram can be considered as an allosteric serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This serotonin dual action in binding to two sites on the serotonin transporter (both the primary site and the allosteric site) is hypothesised to be responsible for a longer binding to, and therefore greater inhibition of the serotonin transporter by escitalopram.},

	abstract = {Molecular representation learning (MRL) has gained tremendous attention due to its critical role in learning from limited supervised data for applications like drug design. In most MRL methods, molecules are treated as 1D sequential tokens or 2D topology graphs, limiting their ability to incorporate 3D information for downstream tasks and, in particular, making it almost impossible for 3D geometry prediction/generation. In this paper, we propose a universal 3D MRL framework, called Uni-Mol, that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope of MRL schemes. Uni-Mol contains two pretrained models with the same SE(3) Transformer architecture: a molecular model pretrained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket model pretrained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. Besides, Uni-Mol contains several finetuning strategies to apply the pretrained models to various downstream tasks. By properly incorporating 3D information, Uni-Mol outperforms SOTA in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction, molecular conformation generation, etc. The code, model, and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol.},

	abstract = {Small organic molecules are often ﬂexible, i.e., they can adopt a variety of low-energy conformations in solution that exist in equilibrium with each other. Two main search strategies are used to generate representative conformational ensembles for molecules: systematic and stochastic. In the ﬁrst approach, each rotatable bond is sampled systematically in discrete intervals, limiting its use to molecules with a small number of rotatable bonds. Stochastic methods, on the other hand, sample the conformational space of a molecule randomly and can thus be applied to more ﬂexible molecules. Diﬀerent methods employ diﬀerent degrees of experimental data for conformer generation. So-called knowledge-based methods use predeﬁned libraries of torsional angles and ring conformations. In the distance geometry approach, on the other hand, a smaller amount of empirical information is used, i.e., ideal bond lengths, ideal bond angles, and a few ideal torsional angles. Distance geometry is a computationally fast method to generate conformers, but it has the downside that purely distance-based constraints tend to lead to distorted aromatic rings and sp2 centers. To correct this, the resulting conformations are often minimized with a force ﬁeld, adding computational complexity and run time. Here we present an alternative strategy that combines the distance geometry approach with experimental torsionangle preferences obtained from small-molecule crystallographic data. The torsional angles are described by a previously developed set of hierarchically structured SMARTS patterns. The new approach is implemented in the open-source cheminformatics library RDKit, and its performance is assessed by comparing the diversity of the generated ensemble and the ability to reproduce crystal conformations taken from the crystal structures of small molecules and protein−ligand complexes.},

	abstract = {An item is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Most biological molecules are chiral. The homochirality of amino acids ensures that proteins are chiral, which is essential for their functions. Chirality also occurs at the whole-cell level, which was first studied mostly in ciliates, single-celled protozoans. Ciliates show chirality in their cortical structures, which is not determined by genetics, but by ‘cortical inheritance’. These studies suggested that molecular chirality directs whole-cell chirality. Intriguingly, chirality in cellular structures and functions is also found in metazoans. In
              Drosophila
              , intrinsic cell chirality is observed in various left–right (LR) asymmetric tissues, and appears to be responsible for their LR asymmetric morphogenesis. In other invertebrates, such as snails and
              Caenorhabditis elegans
              , blastomere chirality is responsible for subsequent LR asymmetric development. Various cultured cells of vertebrates also show intrinsic chirality in their cellular behaviours and intracellular structural dynamics. Thus, cell chirality may be a general property of eukaryotic cells. In
              Drosophila
              , cell chirality drives the LR asymmetric development of individual organs, without establishing the LR axis of the whole embryo. Considering that organ-intrinsic LR asymmetry is also reported in vertebrates, this mechanism may contribute to LR asymmetric development across phyla.

	abstract = {Molecule docking has been regarded as a routine tool for drug discovery, but its accuracy highly depends on the reliability of scoring functions (SFs). With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) techniques, ML-based SFs have gradually emerged as a promising alternative for protein–ligand binding affinity prediction and virtual screening, and most of them have shown significantly better performance than a wide range of classical SFs. Emergence of more data-hungry deep learning (DL) approaches in recent years further fascinates the exploitation of more accurate SFs. Here, we summarize the progress of traditional ML-based SFs in the last few years and provide insights into recently developed DL-based SFs. We believe that the continuous improvement in ML-based SFs can surely guide the early-stage drug design and accelerate the discovery of new drugs.},

	abstract = {A novel method to measure distances between druggable protein cavities is presented. Starting from user-defined ligand binding sites, eight topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages: (i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins is simply done by systematically rotating/ translating one mobile sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties (e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign) and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands with various promiscuity levels. The proposed method is robust enough to detect local similarity among active sites of different sizes, to discriminate between protein subfamilies and to recover the known targets of promiscuous ligands by virtual screening.},

The scoring function can be used to determine the binding mode and site of a ligand, predict binding affinity and identify the potential drug leads for a given protein target. Despite intensive research over the years, accurate and rapid prediction of protein–ligand interactions is still a challenge in molecular docking. For this reason, this study reviews four basic types of scoring functions, physics-based, empirical, knowledgebased, and machine learning-based scoring functions, based on an up-to-date classification scheme. We not only discuss the foundations of the four types scoring functions, suitable application areas and shortcomings, but also discuss challenges and potential future study directions.},

	abstract = {With the exponential increase in publicly available protein structures, the comparison of protein binding sites naturally emerged as a scientiﬁc topic to explain observations or generate hypotheses for ligand design, notably to predict ligand selectivity for on- and off-targets, explain polypharmacology, and design target-focused libraries. The current review summarizes the stateof-the-art computational methods applied to pocket detection and comparison as well as structural druggability estimates. The major strengths and weaknesses of current pocket descriptors, alignment methods, and similarity search algorithms are presented. Lastly, an exhaustive survey of both retrospective and prospective applications in diverse medicinal chemistry scenarios illustrates the capability of the existing methods and the hurdle that still needs to be overcome for more accurate predictions.},

	abstract = {A crucial component in structure-based drug discovery is the availability of highquality three-dimensional structures of the protein target. Whenever experimental structures were not available, homology modeling has been, so far, the method of choice. Recently, AlphaFold (AF), an artiﬁcial-intelligence-based protein structure prediction method, has shown impressive results in terms of model accuracy. This outstanding success prompted us to evaluate how accurate AF models are from the perspective of docking-based drug discovery. We compared the high-throughput docking (HTD) performance of AF models with their corresponding experimental PDB structures using a benchmark set of 22 targets. The AF models showed consistently worse performance using four docking programs and two consensus techniques. Although AlphaFold shows a remarkable ability to predict protein architecture, this might not be enough to guarantee that AF models can be reliably used for HTD, and post-modeling reﬁnement strategies might be key to increase the chances of success.},

	abstract = {Through the representation of small molecule structures as numerical descriptors and the exploitation of the similarity principle, chemoinformatics has made paramount contributions to drug discovery, from unveiling mechanisms of action and repurposing approved drugs to de novo crafting of molecules with desired properties and tailored targets. Yet, the inherent complexity of biological systems has fostered the implementation of large-scale experimental screenings seeking a deeper understanding of the targeted proteins, the disrupted biological processes and the systemic responses of cells to chemical perturbations. After this wealth of data, a new generation of data-driven descriptors has arisen providing a rich portrait of small molecule characteristics that goes beyond chemical properties. Here, we give an overview of biologically relevant descriptors, covering chemical compounds, proteins and other biological entities, such as diseases and cell lines, while aligning them to the major contributions in the field from disciplines, such as natural language processing or computer vision. We now envision a new scenario for chemical and biological entities where they both are translated into a common numerical format. In this computational framework, complex connections between entities can be unveiled by means of simple arithmetic operations, such as distance measures, additions, and subtractions.},

The former, which is using a protein structure and a large chemical database, is wellknown by the scientiﬁc community. We have chosen here to provide an overview on the latter, focusing on validation and target prioritization strategies. By comparing it to complementary or alternative wetlab approaches, we put IVS in the broader context of chemical genomics, target discovery and drug design. By giving examples from the literature and an own example on how to validate the approach, we provide guidance on the issues related to IVS.},

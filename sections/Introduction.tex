Moreover, the vector-like format of the resulting bioactivity descriptors enables them to be readily used in day-to-day cheminformatics tasks. For instance, we showed their utility to navigate the chemical space in a biologically relevant manner, unveiling shared mechanisms of action in the absence of chemical similarity. Additionally, we demonstrated that small molecule bioactivity descriptors provide a significant improvement in performance with respect to chemistry-restricted trained classifiers, across a series of biophysics and physiology activity prediction benchmarks. Indeed, our results showed that the added value of bioactivity descriptors increased together with the biological complexity of the classification tasks [7]

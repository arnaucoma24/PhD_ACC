The main goal of this thesis is to explore and further extend the concept of small molecule and protein druggable binding site descriptors. More specifically, the objectives in each chapter can be outlined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.1}: To implement the CC protocol in order to process, sanitize, compress, harmonize, and integrate novel bioactivity data, resulting in updated or new CC bioactivity spaces (i.e. signatures). 

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.2}: To use CC signatures in classical cheminformatics projects (i.e. clustering and visualizing chemical libraries) and to evaluate and illustrate the added value of bioactivity signatures in providing deeper insights beyond chemical information alone.

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.3}: To systematically explore the relationship between stereoisomerism and bioactivity on a large scale and to develop a signaturization method sensitive to stereoisomeric differences. 

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.4}: To develop and benchmark a novel computational strategy for the characterization of protein druggable binding sites using numerical descriptors, overcoming typical limitations of existing methods. Subsequently, to apply this strategy to generate descriptors for all pockets within human protein domains, to demonstrate its complementarity with traditional structure- and sequence-based approaches and to showcase its ability to recapitulate experimentally observed protein similarities.

\subsection{Code and data availability}
\label{PocketVec_Code}

All the code necessary to generate PocketVec descriptors for any pocket of interest is available in our publicly accessible GitLab repository (\href{https://gitlabsbnb.irbbarcelona.org/acomajuncosa/pocketvec}{https://gitlabsbnb.irbbarcelona.org/acomajuncosa/pocketvec}), together with installation instructions and guidelines for running the code. On average, the generation of a PocketVec descriptor for a protein pocket takes 1h on an Intel Xeon Gold 6138 CPU.

In addition, in the same repository under the results directory, we also provide all the pre-computed descriptors and the comparisons with sequence and structure similarity measurements, as described in the text.

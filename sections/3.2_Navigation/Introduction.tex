\subsection{Introduction}


\hl{Yet, such bioactivity descriptors are scarce, limited mostly to a small number of well-documented molecules. To overcome this problem, we implemented a collection of deep neural networks able to leverage the experimentally determined bioactivity data associated to small molecules and infer the missing bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest10. Originally, our strategy related to bioactivities of 25 different types (including target profiles, cellular responses and clinical outcomes), as described in the Chemical Checker publication}\cite{duran-frigola_extending_2020}.

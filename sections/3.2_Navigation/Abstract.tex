\subsection{Abstract}

Small molecule descriptors typically encode chemical structures and features in high-dimensional numerical vectors. In this work, we first implement a clustering approach based on chemical signatures, aimed at selecting a representative subset from a large library of compounds. We then leverage these chemical signatures to systematically analyze differences between libraries of synthetic small molecules and natural products, underscoring the importance of integrating compounds derived from nature in drug discovery efforts. Finally, we illustrate the added value of inferred bioactivity signatures, which reveal relationships between known protein binders that can not be captured using chemical features alone. Overall, this work emphasizes the significance of chemical signatures in the context of drug discovery and highlights the potential of integrating them with novel data-driven bioactivity signatures.

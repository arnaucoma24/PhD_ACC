As stated in the Objectives section, this thesis aims to explore and further extend the concept of small molecule and protein binding site descriptors, thus laying at the intersection between cheminformatics and bioinformatics. Accordingly and, outlined per each chapter, we have made the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.1}: The implementation of the (preexisting) CC data integration protocol, which represents an optimal framework for generating new bioactivity spaces based on user-provided data, to build novel transcriptomics, proteomics, antibiotics and MoA-based bioactivity signatures. 

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.2}: \hl{The use of CC signatures in .. cheminformatics tasks, such as the clustering of chemical libraries, the visualization of the chemical space in a biologically relevant manner and bla bla bla â€¦}

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.3}: The quantification of bioactivity differences, in terms of protein-ligand binding, between different stereoisomers and the development of stereochemically-aware bioactivity signaturizers. 

\item \textbf{Chapter 3.4}: The development of a novel strategy, named PocketVec, to represent and characterize protein binding sites in the shape of numerical vectors (descriptors). PocketVec descriptors have been comprehensively benchmarked and compared with similar approaches, showing excellent performances in multiple tasks while overcoming the main limitations of existing methods. Additionally, PocketVec descriptors have been generated for all pockets included within human protein domains, using experimentally-determined and accurately-predicted protein structures.

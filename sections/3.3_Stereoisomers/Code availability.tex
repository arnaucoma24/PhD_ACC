\subsection{Code and data availability}
\label{Stereoisomers_Code}

An open source Python package to generate 3D-aware CC bioactivity signatures is available at \href{https://gitlabsbnb.irbbarcelona.org/packages/Signaturizer3d}{https://gitlabsbnb.irbbarcelona.org/packages/Signaturizer3d}. The package includes model weights for each of the 25 CC spaces and can be used to characterize molecules using SMILES or coordinates from existing conformers as input. The models are implemented in Pytorch and support inference on a GPU or CPU. The average time to generate CC signatures from SMILES is 16.3s per 1,000 molecules on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.

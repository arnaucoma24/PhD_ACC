\subsection{Concluding remarks}

We have systematically assessed the relationship between stereoisomerism and bioactivity on a large scale, focusing on compound-target binding events. Subsequently, we used our findings to train the second generation of Signaturizers, which are now stereochemically-aware, thereby providing an even more faithful and accurate representation of complex small molecule bioactivity properties.

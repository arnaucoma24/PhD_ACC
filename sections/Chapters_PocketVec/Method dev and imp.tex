\subsection{Methodological development and implementation}

It is known that similar proteins tend to bind similar ligands\cite{klabunde_chemogenomic_2007}, a principle behind many drug discovery projects\cite{sydow_advances_2019, keiser_relating_2007, falaguera_illuminating_2023}. We re-assessed the validity of this principle and found that, indeed, proteins from the same family (e.g. GPCRs) tend to have more similar active compounds than proteins from different families (\textbf{Fig S1}). However, globally dissimilar proteins showing similar physicochemical and shape properties in their druggable pockets may still bind with similar ligands, which reasonably translates into a more precise and general form of the chemogenomics principle: similar pockets bind similar ligands\cite{gao_comprehensive_2013}. PocketVec builds on this observation to generate novel vector-type descriptors for characterizing protein small molecule binding pockets.

\subsection{Introduction}

Ligand binding sites are protein regions that interact with other biochemical entities such as peptides or organic small molecules. The binding process eventually results in a selective modulation of the protein function. Indeed, one of the most successful strategies in conventional drug discovery is to identify, based on the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of binding sites, small molecules that activate or inhibit a protein associated with a disease\cite{sadybekov_computational_2023}.

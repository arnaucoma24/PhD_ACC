\subsection{Code and data availability}
\label{Protocols_Code}

All data and code necessary to reproduce the implemented protocols (4 tasks) are available in our \href{https://gitlabsbnb.irbbarcelona.org/packages/protocols}{Gitlab repository} in the form of CSV/H5 files and Jupyter Notebooks, respectively, along with all generated CC signatures. Additionally, a detailed description of the protocol can be found in the \hyperref[Protocols_Methods]{Methods} section. 


Finally, in order to generate CC type III signatures, the user needs to collect all type II signatures from the current CC universe. Signatures can be downloaded as plain data files from \href{https://chemicalchecker.com/downloads/root}{https://chemicalchecker.com/downloads/root}, or accessed through the CC REST API (\href{https://chemicalchecker.com/help}{https://chemicalchecker.com/help}, bottom of the page).

\subsection{Code and data availability}
\label{Protocols_Code}

All code necessary to reproduce the implemented protocols (4 tasks) is available in our \href{https://gitlabsbnb.irbbarcelona.org/packages/protocols}{Gitlab repository} in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, a detailed description of the computational protocol can be found in the \hyperref[Protocols_Methods]{Methods} section. Both raw data to generate new bioactivity spaces (CSV/H5 files) and the obtained final signatures (H5 files) are included in Zenodo repositories, as detailed in our Gitlab.
